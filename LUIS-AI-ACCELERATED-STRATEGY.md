## CRITICAL: AI as COPILOT, Not Autopilot

### DO Use AI For:
- ✅ Generating drafts (resume bullets, cover letters, messages)
- ✅ Research (company info, interview questions, salary data)
- ✅ Volume (auto-apply to 10-15 jobs/day)
- ✅ Optimization (ATS keywords, LinkedIn SEO)
- ✅ Tracking (organize applications, follow-ups)

### DON'T Use AI For:
- ❌ Sending unedited messages (always personalize)
- ❌ Attending interviews (obviously)
- ❌ Replacing networking (AI can't build Ross relationships)
- ❌ Making decisions (which offer to accept)
- ❌ Faking expertise (AI answers must be YOUR answers)

### The Rule:
**"AI writes, you edit and personalize. AI suggests, you decide."**
