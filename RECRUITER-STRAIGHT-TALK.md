# Executive Recruiter's Straight Talk
## What Luis Calderon Needs to Hear (No Sugar Coating)

*Perspective: 20 years placing CPOs, VPs Product, C-suite at startups and growth companies*

---

## Your Profile At A Glance

**What I See:**
- Ross MBA, GMAT 720 (strong pedigree)
- Founder/CEO, $3M+ revenue company (real operator)
- 20+ years experience (senior level)
- E-commerce/Shopify expertise (marketable)
- Posting about AI (trendy but unproven depth)

**Market Value: $180-250K base (full-time) | $200-400/hr (fractional)**

---

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH: Your Gaps

### Gap #1: LinkedIn Profile is Amateur Hour
**What's wrong:**
- I can't tell what you do in first 3 seconds
- Your headline doesn't match your seniority
- About section doesn't lead with results
- Featured section isn't showcasing SketchPop wins
- You have 500 connections - should be 2000+ for your level
- Skills aren't optimized for search (recruiters won't find you)

**How it hurts you:**
- When I search "fractional CPO e-commerce" you don't show up
- When VCs/founders look at your profile, they're confused about positioning
- You're invisible to 90% of opportunities

**Fix:**
- Headline: "Fractional CPO | Scaled E-commerce to $3M+ | Product Strategy for High-Growth Startups"
- About: Lead with numbers first (revenue, growth rate, team size)
- Featured: Case study, SketchPop metrics, thought leadership
- Get to 1500+ connections minimum (connect with everyone in product/e-commerce)
- Post 3x/week minimum (visibility = opportunities)

**Timeline: Fix this TODAY. Not tomorrow. TODAY.**

---

### Gap #2: No Portable Proof of Work
**What's wrong:**
- SketchPop is your company - I can't verify the $3M claim easily
- No case studies, no portfolio, no deck
- Can't see your product decisions or their impact
- No testimonials from team/customers/investors

**How it hurts you:**
- Companies ask: "Did you really build a $3M company or is this inflated?"
- Without proof, you're just another person claiming big numbers
- I can't pitch you to clients without materials

**Fix:**
- Create one-page case study: "How I Scaled SketchPop to $3M+"
  - Challenge, approach, results, learnings
  - Include screenshots, metrics, charts
  - Make it visual and concrete
- Get 3-5 LinkedIn recommendations:
  - From SketchPop team members
  - From customers (if possible)
  - From Ross alumni who know your work
- Build simple portfolio site or Notion page:
  - About, Experience, SketchPop Case Study, Contact
  - Domain: luiscalderon.com or similar

**Timeline: Case study by end of this week. Recommendations by next week.**

---

### Gap #3: You're Not Visible in the Market
**What's wrong:**
- You're not posting regularly on LinkedIn
- Not engaging with product community
- Not speaking/writing about your expertise
- Hidden gem that nobody knows about

**How it hurts you:**
- When opportunity arises, you're not top-of-mind
- Recruiters don't know you exist
- Your Ross network doesn't know you're available
- You're competing on resume, not on reputation

**Fix:**
- Post on LinkedIn 3x/week (minimum 2x/week):
  - Monday: Product strategy insight from SketchPop
  - Wednesday: Engage with others' posts (comment meaningfully on 10 posts)
  - Friday: Share industry trend + your take
- Join and participate in:
  - Lenny's Newsletter community (Slack)
  - Product School
  - Mind the Product
  - Reforge (if alumni)
  - Ross alumni product groups
- Comment on posts from:
  - VCs in your network
  - Product leaders
  - E-commerce founders
  - Ross alumni

**Timeline: Start TODAY. First post goes up tonight or tomorrow AM.**

---

### Gap #4: Unclear on What You Actually Want
**What's wrong:**
- Are you looking for fractional or full-time?
- Do you want CPO role or VP Product?
- Are you staying with SketchPop or going full-time elsewhere?
- What's your geographic preference?
- What stage companies? (Series A, B, C?)
- What industries? (Just e-commerce or broader?)

**How it hurts you:**
- I can't help you if I don't know what you want
- Your network can't make intros because they don't know what to look for
- Confused positioning = no positioning

**Fix:**
- Get crystal clear on ideal role:
  - **Primary**: Fractional CPO for Series A-C e-commerce/DTC startups (15-25 hrs/week, $15-25K/month)
  - **Secondary**: VP Product at Series B+ e-commerce company (full-time, $200-250K + equity)
  - **Geography**: Remote-first, open to occasional travel
  - **Non-negotiables**: Product-market fit achieved, strong founder, growth trajectory
- Put this clarity in LinkedIn headline, about section, all outreach

**Timeline: Decide THIS TODAY. Write it down. Commit to it.**

---

### Gap #5: Not Leveraging Your Biggest Asset (Ross)
**What's wrong:**
- You have access to 60,000 Ross MBA alumni
- Many are VCs, founders, executives, recruiters
- You're not systematically reaching out to them
- Missing warm intros that are 10x better than cold outreach

**How it hurts you:**
- You're competing on job boards with 500 other candidates
- Could be getting warm intros from Ross VCs to their portfolio companies
- Ross alumni WANT to help other Ross alumni (cultural thing)

**Fix:**
- TODAY: Map 50 Ross alumni across these categories:
  - 10 VCs
  - 10 Founders/CEOs
  - 10 Product Leaders
  - 10 Recruiters
  - 10 Consultants
- THIS WEEK: Reach out to 20 of them with personalized messages
- Template: "Fellow Wolverine - exploring fractional CPO opportunities, would value your perspective"
- Ask each: "Who in your network might need fractional product leadership?"
- Get intros, don't apply cold

**Timeline: Network mapping TODAY. First 10 messages go out TODAY.**

---

### Gap #6: No Fractional Platform Presence
**What's wrong:**
- Not on Toptal, GrowthExpert, TechCXO, GigX
- These platforms actively match fractional executives with companies
- Missing vetted opportunities coming through these channels

**How it hurts you:**
- Companies looking for fractional CPOs find your competitors, not you
- These platforms do marketing for you - you're not leveraging it
- Vetted status = credibility boost

**Fix:**
- Apply to ALL of these THIS WEEK:
  - Toptal (most selective, highest rates)
  - GrowthExpert (good for growth-stage)
  - TechCXO (interim exec focus)
  - GigX (project-based)
- Application requires:
  - Updated resume
  - Professional summary
  - Hourly rate ($250-400/hr range)
  - Case study (see Gap #2)
- Pass their vetting process (interviews, background checks)

**Timeline: Toptal application TODAY. Others by end of week.**

---

## How You ACTUALLY Stand Out

Most CPO candidates have:
- Worked at companies others built
- Managed products in established markets
- Led teams but didn't build companies
- Theory from MBA, limited operator experience

**You have:**
1. **Built a company from $0 to $3M** (rare)
2. **Ross MBA pedigree** (instant credibility)
3. **E-commerce operator experience** (valuable niche)
4. **Can start immediately** (no notice period)
5. **Fractional-ready** (companies love this flexibility)

**Where you're ACTUALLY differentiated:**
- Not theory, practice: "I've done this with my own money on the line"
- Operator perspective: "I understand P&L, not just product"
- Speed: "I can start next week"
- Risk mitigation: "Try me fractional before full commitment"

**What you should be saying in every conversation:**
> "I've scaled a company to $3M+ as founder. I know what it's like when product decisions directly impact revenue and survival. Most CPOs have product experience - I have operator experience. And I can start immediately on a fractional basis to prove value before you commit full-time."

That pitch gets attention.

## What You Should Do RIGHT NOW (Next 2 Hours)

I'm going to tell you exactly what to do in the next 120 minutes:

### Minutes 1-30: Fix LinkedIn Headline & About
**Headline:**
"Fractional CPO & Product Leader | Scaled SketchPop to $3M+ ARR | Ross MBA | E-commerce & AI Strategy | Open to Fractional & FT Roles"

**About Section:**
```
I help high-growth startups build products customers love - and I've proven it by scaling my own company to $3M+ in annual revenue.

As Founder/CEO of SketchPop LLC, I've lived every product decision a startup faces: finding product-market fit, scaling operations, optimizing conversion, integrating AI, and building teams that execute. I did it with my own capital at risk.

Now I'm bringing that operator experience to other founders through fractional CPO and VP Product roles.

What I bring:
• Product Strategy: 0-to-1 and scale-up experience
• E-commerce Expertise: Built $3M+ business on Shopify
• AI Integration: Implemented and shipped AI features that moved metrics
• Team Leadership: Hired, managed, scaled cross-functional teams
• Operator Mindset: Product + Business + Technical fluency
• Ross MBA: Strategic thinking, business acumen (GMAT 720)

Available for:
- Fractional CPO (15-25 hrs/week, $15-25K/month)
- Interim CPO placements
- VP Product (full-time, Series B+)
- Product consulting engagements

Let's connect if you're building something ambitious and need strategic product leadership without the full-time cost.

**To Ross VCs:**

```
Subject: Fellow Wolverine - Fractional CPO Question

Hi [Name],

Luis Calderon here - Ross MBA '11. I saw you're at [VC Firm] - congrats on [recent news/investment if applicable].

Quick context: I've been running SketchPop (custom art e-commerce) and scaled it to $3M+ ARR. As we're hitting growth milestones, I'm exploring fractional CPO opportunities to help other founders navigate the product challenges I've solved.

Given your focus on [their investment thesis], curious if any of your portfolio companies are at the stage where they need strategic product leadership but aren't ready for a full-time CPO?

I've gotten particularly good at e-commerce product strategy and AI integration (recently shipped features at SketchPop that materially moved conversion).

Happy to share what I learned if it's valuable to your founders.

15-min call this week if you're open?

Go Blue,
Luis

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**You're not special.**

There are 100 other Ross MBAs looking for product roles right now.

There are 500 "founders" claiming they built multi-million dollar companies.

There are 1000 people posting about AI integration.

**What makes you get the job:**
- You activate your network faster than they do
- You prove your value better than they do
- You show up more consistently than they do
- You follow up when they give up
- You make it easy for people to help you

**The market doesn't care about:**
- Your GMAT score
- Where you went to school
- How hard you worked

**The market cares about:**
- Can you solve my problem?
- Can you start quickly?
- Can I afford you?
- Do I trust you?
- Did someone I trust introduce you?

**That's it.**

Your job is to:
1. Get in front of decision makers (network)
2. Show proof you can solve their problem (case study)
3. Make it easy to say yes (fractional)
4. Be trusted (Ross connections, recommendations)

**Everything else is noise.**

## Final Recruiter Advice

**I've placed 200+ executives.**

The ones who get great roles in 60-90 days have these traits:

1. **Clarity**: They know exactly what they want
2. **Materials**: Resume, portfolio, case study ready in week 1
3. **Network**: They activate it immediately and systematically
4. **Consistency**: Daily outreach, no excuses
5. **Follow-up**: They're relentless but professional
6. **Value-first**: They give before they ask
7. **Speed**: They respond within hours, not days
8. **Flexibility**: They're open to fractional, interim, contract
9. **Evidence**: They show proof, not just claims
10. **Likability**: People want to help them

**The ones who take 6-12 months:**

1. Unclear on what they want
2. Materials aren't ready until week 4-6
3. Rely on job boards, not network
4. Inconsistent effort (busy some weeks, nothing others)
5. Don't follow up
6. Lead with asks, not value
7. Take days to respond to opportunities
8. Want full-time only, won't consider fractional
9. All talk, no proof
10. Come across as entitled

**Which one are you going to be?**

---

## My Challenge to You

**I don't care if you read all these documents.**

**I care if you EXECUTE.**

**Here's the test:**

By 9 PM tonight, you should have:
- [ ] Updated LinkedIn headline
- [ ] Updated LinkedIn about section
- [ ] Sent 5 messages to Ross VCs
- [ ] Applied to Toptal
- [ ] Set up tracking spreadsheet

**If you do these 5 things, you're serious.**

**If you don't, you're not ready to find a job in 60 days.**

**It's that simple.**

Stop reading.

Start executing.

**RIGHT NOW.**

---

## P.S. - The Real Talk

You asked for straight talk. Here it is:

**You have everything you need to land a great role:**
- Strong background
- Proven results
- Valuable expertise
- Powerful network
- Clear market demand

**What you're missing is URGENCY and ACTION.**

60-90 days is FAST. Most people take 6-12 months.

You're running SketchPop. You're busy. I get it.

But if you're serious about landing a role in 60-90 days, you need to treat this like a product launch.

**You wouldn't soft-launch a product.**
**You wouldn't skip marketing for a product.**
**You wouldn't ignore your best distribution channel for a product.**

So why are you doing that with your job search?

**Treat YOU like the product:**
- Product (you) needs positioning (LinkedIn)
- Product needs proof (case study)
- Product needs distribution (network)
- Product needs marketing (outreach, content)
- Product needs sales (interviews, proposals)

**You know how to launch products.**

**Now launch yourself.**

**Today.**
