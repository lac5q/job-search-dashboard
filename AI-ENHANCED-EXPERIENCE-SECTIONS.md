## INTERVIEW PREP: AI-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

### Question 1: "What AI products have you shipped?"

**Your Enhanced Answer:**
> "I've shipped AI products at two different scales:
>
> At Intuit, I shipped multiple AI/ML products with Human-in-the-Loop training for the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business. These products used predictive algorithms trained on millions of tax returns to help self-employed users optimize deductions and maximize refunds. We coordinated AI initiatives across business units to ensure consistent experiences.
>
> The HITL approach was critical—we used tax professional reviews to continuously train and improve our models, which improved prediction accuracy by 20%+ over baseline ML models.
>
> At SketchPop, I deployed an AI chatbot that reduced customer service costs by 40% while maintaining our 4.8-star rating. We also built AI agents for order routing and artist assignment, which let our 30-person team handle 2x the order volume. I rebuilt our backend specifically to enable rapid AI feature deployment.
>
> I've also consulted on AI operations at Ivo.AI and other startups, advising on LLM integration, AI agent frameworks, and build vs. buy decisions.
>
> I stay current by using GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama daily for product work—everything from user research to data analysis to prototyping features."

---

### Question 2: "How do you measure AI product success?"

**Your Enhanced Answer:**
> "I measure AI at three levels—business impact, product metrics, and technical performance:
>
> **Business Impact:**
> - At SketchPop, our AI chatbot drove 40% cost reduction with maintained CSAT
> - At Intuit, our HITL tax optimization improved user outcomes (higher refunds, fewer errors)
> - ROI calculation: Cost of AI implementation vs. cost savings or revenue lift
>
> **Product Metrics:**
> - Adoption: What % of eligible users engage with AI features?
> - Satisfaction: CSAT, NPS for AI-driven experiences
> - Efficiency: Time saved, clicks reduced, automation rate
> - Accuracy: How often does the AI prediction match user expectations?
>
> **Technical Performance:**
> - Model accuracy, precision, recall (for ML models)
> - Latency: Response time for AI features
> - Hallucination rate: For LLMs, how often do they produce nonsense?
> - HITL effectiveness: How much does human feedback improve models?
>
> The key is connecting technical metrics to business outcomes. A 95% accurate model means nothing if it doesn't drive adoption, reduce costs, or increase revenue."

---

### Question 3: "What's your AI build vs. buy philosophy?"

**Your Enhanced Answer:**
> "My framework has three factors:
>
> **1. Core Differentiation:**
> - If AI is your core product differentiator, build custom
> - If AI is table stakes or infrastructure, buy/use APIs
> - Example: Intuit built custom tax models (core value), SketchPop used third-party chatbot APIs (commodity feature)
>
> **2. Data Advantage:**
> - Do you have unique proprietary data? Build custom models
> - Using generic data? Leverage foundation models (GPT-4, Claude)
> - Example: Intuit's millions of tax returns = data moat, justified custom ML
>
> **3. Speed vs. Accuracy Trade-off:**
> - Need to prove value fast? Start with APIs (GPT-4, Claude)
> - Need custom accuracy? Build once you've validated demand
> - Example: SketchPop started with third-party chatbot to get 40% cost savings quickly
>
> My default: Start with foundation model APIs to validate product-market fit, then build custom only if data moat or differentiation warrant the investment."

---

### Question 4: "How do you stay current with AI developments?"

**Your Enhanced Answer:**
> "I'm a daily AI practitioner—it's not optional in 2025:
>
> **Daily Hands-On Use:**
> - I use GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama every day for product work
> - Writing PRDs, analyzing data, prototyping features, conducting user research
> - This keeps me grounded in what's actually possible vs. hype
>
> **Technical Community:**
> - Follow AI researchers on Twitter/X (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta teams)
> - Read key papers (especially around LLM capabilities, HITL, agent frameworks)
> - Participate in AI product communities and Slack groups
>
> **Consulting Exposure:**
> - Through Ivo.AI and other engagements, I see diverse AI use cases across industries
> - Learn what's working (and what's not) in real production environments
> - Stay exposed to latest vendor solutions and emerging AI companies
>
> **Experimentation:**
> - I prototype AI features regularly using GPT-4/Claude APIs
> - Test new models as they release (recently tested Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.0)
> - Hands-on is the only way to truly understand capabilities and limitations
>
> Being a practitioner—not just a reader—is critical for AI product leadership."
