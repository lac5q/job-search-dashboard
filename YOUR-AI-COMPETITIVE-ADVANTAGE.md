## 💪 Your Specific AI Strengths

### 1. **Traditional Machine Learning (Pre-LLM Era)**

**What You Know:**
- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) training
- Supervised learning for classification
- Predictive algorithms
- Model training on large datasets (millions of tax returns)
- Feature engineering
- A/B testing AI features
- ML model accuracy optimization

**Why This Matters:**
- Most "AI product leaders" only know LLMs
- Traditional ML still powers most enterprise AI
- Understanding HITL makes you credible to ML engineers
- You can evaluate when to use ML vs. LLMs

**Interview Talking Point:**
> "At Intuit, I shipped traditional ML products using Human-in-the-Loop training. We trained models on millions of tax returns to predict audit risk and identify missed deductions. This taught me the fundamentals of ML product management—model training, accuracy metrics, A/B testing, and continuous improvement cycles. That foundation helps me evaluate when to use traditional ML vs. modern LLMs."

---

### 2. **Modern LLM Deployment (Post-ChatGPT Era)**

**What You've Done:**
- Deployed GPT-4 and Claude chatbots in production
- Implemented AI agents for operational workflows
- Built LLM-powered customer communication tools
- Integrated AI into existing business processes
- Achieved measurable ROI (40% cost reduction)

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows you're current with latest AI capabilities
- Proves you can deploy AI, not just plan it
- 40% cost reduction is a killer metric
- Demonstrates operational AI, not just customer-facing

**Interview Talking Point:**
> "In 2025, I deployed AI chatbots at SketchPop using GPT-4 and Claude, achieving 40% cost reduction while maintaining customer satisfaction. The key was treating AI as an operational tool, not just a feature. We also built AI agents for order routing and artist assignment, which let our 30-person team handle 2x the order volume. I stay hands-on with latest LLMs—GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama—because you can't lead AI product development without understanding what's possible."

### 3. **AI at Multiple Scales**

**You've shipped AI at:**

1. **Enterprise Scale (Intuit - $900M business)**
   - Millions of users
   - Cross-business-unit coordination
   - Regulatory compliance (IRS tax rules)
   - Team of 4 PMs
   - Multi-year roadmaps

2. **SMB Scale (SketchPop - $3M business)**
   - 30-person team
   - Tight margins (need ROI fast)
   - Operational AI focus
   - Rapid deployment (move fast)
   - Direct P&L impact

3. **Startup Scale (Consulting - Early-stage companies)**
   - Limited resources
   - Need to prove value quickly
   - Build vs. buy trade-offs
   - MVP approach to AI

**Why This Matters:**
- You can talk to any company at any stage
- You understand AI constraints at different scales
- You've seen what works (and what doesn't) across contexts

**Interview Talking Point:**
> "I've shipped AI at three different scales: at Intuit with $900M P&L and millions of users, at SketchPop with a 30-person team and tight margins, and at startups through consulting where resources are extremely limited. Each scale requires different approaches—at Intuit, we could invest in custom ML models because we had unique data and scale. At SketchPop, I used third-party APIs to get 40% cost reduction fast. The build vs. buy decision depends on your data advantage, scale, and speed requirements."

## 🎤 Your 30-Second AI Pitch

**Use this when someone asks "What's your AI experience?"**

> "I've been shipping AI products since 2021—before the ChatGPT explosion. At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business and shipped 4 major AI/ML products using Human-in-the-Loop training: expense categorization, deduction finder, audit risk prediction, and document extraction. These served millions of self-employed users.
>
> Then in 2025, I deployed modern LLM capabilities at SketchPop—AI chatbots and agents that reduced customer service costs 40% while handling 2x order volume with the same team size. I also consult on AI strategy through GrowthAlchemyLab, advising companies like Ivo.AI on AI operations and LLM integration.
>
> So I understand both traditional ML and modern LLMs, and I've shipped AI at scale ($900M) and at startups (<$3M). That dual perspective—enterprise discipline plus startup speed—is what I bring to AI product leadership."

## 🚫 Common Objections & Your Responses

### Objection 1: "But you left Intuit in 2024, so you're not current with latest AI"

**Your Response:**
> "Actually, I deployed AI chatbots at SketchPop in 2025 using the latest GPT-4 and Claude models, achieving 40% cost reduction. I also consult on AI strategy through GrowthAlchemyLab, where I advise companies on LLM integration and AI operations. I use GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama daily for product work. Staying current with AI requires hands-on implementation, and I've done that both at SketchPop and through consulting."

---

### Objection 2: "Your Intuit AI work was 2021-2024—that's 'old AI' now"

**Your Response:**
> "The fundamentals of AI product management haven't changed—understanding model training, measuring accuracy, A/B testing features, and coordinating cross-functional teams. What I learned at Intuit with Human-in-the-Loop training directly applies to fine-tuning modern LLMs. In fact, companies using LLMs at scale are rediscovering the need for HITL approaches to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy. Having that foundation makes me more effective with modern AI, not less."

---

### Objection 3: "SketchPop is small—how does that translate to our scale?"

**Your Response:**
> "That's actually why my background is valuable—I've shipped AI at both extremes. At Intuit, I managed $900M P&L with millions of users, so I understand enterprise scale, regulatory compliance, and cross-BU coordination. At SketchPop, I deployed AI with tight margins where every dollar matters, so I understand ROI and capital-efficient AI. Most product leaders have only worked at one scale. I can translate between them."

---

### Objection 4: "We need someone who's built AI products from scratch, not consultants"

**Your Response:**
> "I've built AI products from scratch at two companies—Intuit and SketchPop—and shipping is my focus. The consulting through GrowthAlchemyLab keeps me exposed to diverse AI use cases and latest technologies across industries, which makes me a better builder. At SketchPop, I personally deployed our AI chatbot and agents—hands-on implementation, not just strategy. Consulting is 10-20% of my time; 80%+ is building and operating."
