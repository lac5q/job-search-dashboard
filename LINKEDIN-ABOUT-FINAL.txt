I bring enterprise scale, AI/ML product expertise, and operational turnaround experience—rare in product leadership.

At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group Product Manager, shipping multiple AI/ML products with human-in-the-loop (HITL) training. I managed a team of 4 PMs, drove 10-15% CAGR revenue growth, and coordinated cross-business-unit AI initiatives. My AI products helped millions of self-employed users optimize tax outcomes using predictive algorithms.

As CEO of SketchPop LLC, I acquired Custom Caricatures and drove post-acquisition transformation through AI: deployed AI agents for customer service (40% cost reduction), rebuilt backend with modern AI infrastructure, and implemented AI-driven approval flows. I work extensively with AI agents, LLM orchestration, and operational AI deployment. Currently scaling to $3M revenue with 30-person team and 20% margins.

I stay current with latest AI developments—daily user of GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama for product work and have consulted on AI operations (including sales AI at Ivo.AI).

I don't just understand AI products—I ship them at scale and deploy them operationally to drive measurable business outcomes.

What I offer:
• AI/ML Product Leadership: Shipped HITL products at $900M scale (Intuit), deployed AI agents operationally (SketchPop 40% cost reduction)
• Enterprise Product Strategy: Led $900M unit with cross-BU AI coordination
• Acquisition & Turnaround: Acquired business, drove AI-powered transformation
• Operational AI Deployment: AI agents, customer service automation, AI-driven workflows

• Team Leadership: Managed 4 PMs at Intuit, scaled 30-person team at SketchPop
• Ross MBA: Strategic thinking, business acumen (GMAT 720, Top 4%)

Currently seeking:
VP Product, Director of Product, Head of Product, or Principal PM roles where I can lead AI/ML product initiatives at scale. Particularly interested in companies embedding AI into their core products or building AI-first experiences.

Ideal fit: Series B-D companies scaling AI products, PE-backed companies modernizing with AI, or established tech companies building AI product orgs.

Location: San Diego preferred, open to remote, willing to travel to LA/SF.

Let's connect if you need product leadership that combines enterprise AI experience with hands-on AI implementation.
