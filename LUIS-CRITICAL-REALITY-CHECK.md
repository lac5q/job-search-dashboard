# Luis - Critical Reality Check

## The Brutal Truth About Your Situation

I looked at your LinkedIn. Here's what I see and what it means for your job search.

---

## What's Working FOR You

### 1. Your Background is Legitimately Strong
- **Ross MBA, GMAT 720**: This puts you in top tier for credibility
- **$3M+ revenue company**: This is real proof you can execute
- **20+ years experience**: You're not junior, you're senior leadership
- **Shopify/E-commerce**: This expertise is in demand right now
- **You're posting about AI/automation**: Shows thought leadership

### 2. You Have The Right Network
- **4K+ LinkedIn followers**: Above average visibility
- **500+ connections**: But this should be 2000+ for your level
- **Ross alumni network**: 60,000+ MBAs, many in positions to hire you
- **You're recruiting talent**: Shows you understand hiring/team building

### 3. Timing is Actually Good
- **Fractional CPO market is HOT**: Companies want expertise without full-time cost
- **E-commerce still growing**: Your domain expertise matters
- **AI integration**: Your recent focus is perfectly timed
- **Q4/Q1**: Budget season for many companies, hiring decisions being made

## What's Working AGAINST You

### 1. Your LinkedIn Positioning is Confusing
**Problem**: I had to DIG to understand what you actually do
- Profile doesn't scream "Product Leader" immediately
- SketchPop isn't prominently featured as achievement
- Your "About" section needs to lead with results, not background
- Skills section doesn't prioritize product leadership

**Impact**:
- Recruiters won't find you in searches
- Your network doesn't know you're looking
- You're not positioned for the roles you want

**Fix**: TODAY - rewrite headline and about section (see today's action plan)

### 2. You're Not Visibly Active Enough
**Problem**: Need more consistent LinkedIn presence
- Posting about AI is good, but need more frequency
- Should be posting 2-3x/week about product leadership insights
- Not enough engagement visible (comments, shares)
- Your SketchPop wins should be content gold - not seeing enough of this

**Impact**:
- Network doesn't know you're available
- Missing opportunities to demonstrate expertise
- Not top-of-mind when opportunities arise

**Fix**:
- This week: 2 LinkedIn posts about SketchPop product lessons
- Daily: Comment on 10 relevant posts
- Share insights from your experience (you have TONS of material)

### 3. You Haven't Activated Your Biggest Asset: Ross Network
**Problem**: 60,000 Ross MBAs and you're not leveraging them
- Ross alumni LOVE helping other Ross alumni (this is real)
- Many Ross alumni are VCs, founders, executives who can hire you
- You should be getting warm intros through Ross, not cold applying

**Impact**:
- You're competing on generic job boards instead of getting warm intros
- Missing the single biggest advantage you have
- Warm intro from Ross alum = 10x better than cold application

**Fix**:
- TODAY: Map your Ross network (see action plan)
- THIS WEEK: Reach out to 20 Ross alumni
- Join Ross alumni groups/events
- Contact Ross career services (they help alumni!)

### 4. Your Timeline is TIGHT But You're Not Moving Like It
**Problem**: 60-90 days is aggressive, but your job search isn't matching the urgency
- Empty directory = you haven't started building materials
- No visible portfolio/case study yet
- Not applying to fractional platforms yet
- Haven't reached out to network yet

**Impact**:
- You're behind where you need to be for 60-day goal
- Each day of delay = harder to hit target
- Need to compress timeline significantly

**Fix**:
- TODAY: Execute the 4-hour plan (LinkedIn + Network + Toptal)
- THIS WEEK: Apply to all fractional platforms
- THIS WEEK: Send 50+ personalized outreach messages
- Treat this like you're launching a product (because you are - the product is YOU)

## The Math of Your Job Search

**For 1 offer in 60 days, you need:**

| Activity | Weekly | Total (8 weeks) |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Outreach messages | 20-30 | 160-240 |
| Meaningful conversations | 5-8 | 40-64 |
| Informational interviews | 2-3 | 16-24 |
| Actual interviews | 1-2 | 8-16 |
| Final rounds | 0-1 | 2-4 |

**You're currently at:**
- Outreach: 0
- Conversations: 0
- Interviews: 0

**You need to get to 20-30 outreach THIS WEEK to stay on track.**

## Where You'll Probably Fail (And How to Avoid It)

### Failure Mode 1: "I'll start tomorrow / next week"
**The Pattern**:
- Today you're busy with SketchPop
- Tomorrow you'll be busy with something else
- You keep "preparing" but not executing

**The Fix**:
- Block 2 hours TODAY on your calendar (non-negotiable)
- Put "Job Search" on your calendar like it's a client meeting
- Execute the LinkedIn update RIGHT NOW (it takes 30 minutes)

### Failure Mode 2: "Waiting for perfect materials"
**The Pattern**:
- "I need to build a perfect portfolio first"
- "My resume isn't ready"
- "I should take this course first"
- Meanwhile, 2 weeks pass with no outreach

**The Fix**:
- Ship Version 1.0 TODAY
- Your SketchPop results ARE your portfolio
- Simple Google Doc case study > no portfolio
- Outreach with "here's what I built" > waiting for perfect deck

### Failure Mode 3: "Spray and pray on job boards"
**The Pattern**:
- Apply to 100 generic "Product Manager" roles on Indeed
- Send same resume each time
- Wait for responses
- Get discouraged when nothing happens

**The Fix**:
- Your network >>> job boards
- Ross alumni network >>> everything else
- 10 warm intros > 100 cold applications
- EVERY outreach must be personalized
- Focus on fractional platforms + direct networking

### Failure Mode 4: "Not following up"
**The Pattern**:
- Send message to 20 people
- 15 don't respond
- Give up
- Miss that 80% of results come after 3+ touchpoints

**The Fix**:
- Follow up after 5-7 days (ALWAYS)
- 2nd follow up after another week
- Track everything in spreadsheet
- Most people are busy, not ignoring you
- Persistence wins

### Failure Mode 5: "Trying to do everything yourself"
**The Pattern**:
- Don't ask network for help
- Don't leverage Ross resources
- Don't tell people you're looking
- Suffer in silence

**The Fix**:
- TELL YOUR NETWORK YOU'RE LOOKING (today!)
- Ask for specific intros
- Use Ross career services
- People WANT to help - let them

### 4. AI Integration is Hot

## The ONE Thing That Will Make or Break This

**Consistency.**

Not motivation. Not perfect materials. Not luck.

**Consistency.**

- 3-4 hours EVERY DAY
- 10 outreach messages EVERY DAY
- 5 LinkedIn engagements EVERY DAY
- 1 follow-up EVERY DAY

**Miss 3 days = you're behind.**
**Miss a week = you probably won't hit 60 days.**

This is why you need to:
1. Block time on calendar NOW
2. Treat it like client work
3. Don't let SketchPop be excuse (you can do both)

---

## Your Biggest Risk

**Being too busy with SketchPop to prioritize this.**

I get it. You're running a $3M company. You have a team. Customers. Operations.

But:
- You said you need a job in 60-90 days
- That suggests SketchPop isn't paying you enough OR you need more stability
- Which means job search IS the priority

**You have to choose:**
- Option A: Treat job search like a part-time job (20 hrs/week), compress SketchPop time
- Option B: Keep current SketchPop time, do light job search, miss 60-day target
- Option C: Get help with SketchPop (hire/delegate) to free up job search time

**There's no Option D where you do both at 100% and hit 60 days.**

What's it going to be?

Based on everything I see:

### Positioning:
"Fractional CPO for Series A-C E-commerce/DTC Startups | Operator Experience Scaling SketchPop to $3M+ on Shopify"

### Strategy:
1. **80% Ross network** (VCs, founders, product leaders)
2. **15% Fractional platforms** (Toptal, GrowthExpert, TechCXO)
3. **5% Job boards** (only for highly targeted roles)

### Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Foundation (LinkedIn, network mapping, first outreach)
- **Week 2-3**: Momentum (50+ conversations, interviews starting)
- **Week 4-6**: Conversion (active opportunities, small fractional projects)
- **Week 7-8**: Close (offers, negotiation, decision)

### Daily Discipline:
- **Morning (90 min)**: Outreach + network engagement
- **Afternoon (60 min)**: Interviews/calls + follow-ups
- **Evening (30 min)**: Content (LinkedIn posts) + tracking

**Total: 3 hours/day. Non-negotiable.**
