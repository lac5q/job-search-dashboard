- Your network matters MORE than LinkedIn applications

### Template 1: Ross VC Alumni
```
Subject: Fellow Wolverine - Fractional CPO Question

Hi [Name],

Luis Calderon here - Ross MBA '11. I saw you're at [VC Firm] now - congrats on the move!

Quick context: I've been running SketchPop (custom art e-commerce) and scaled it to $3M+ revenue. As we're hitting growth milestones, I'm exploring fractional CPO opportunities to leverage my operator experience helping other companies scale.

Given your portfolio, I'm curious if any of your companies are at the stage where they need strategic product leadership but aren't ready for a full-time CPO?

I've been particularly focused on e-commerce/DTC and AI integration (recently implemented some cool stuff at SketchPop that meaningfully moved conversion).

Happy to share what I learned scaling my own product if it's valuable to your founders.

Go Blue!
Luis

P.S. [Personal note based on their LinkedIn activity]

I'm currently exploring fractional CPO work after scaling my e-commerce company (SketchPop) to $3M+ revenue.

Two quick questions:
1. Are you fully set on product leadership, or is that a gap you're thinking about?
2. If you're covered, anyone in your network (Ross or otherwise) who might need strategic product help on a fractional basis?

I've gotten good at product strategy for growth-stage companies, especially in e-commerce/DTC, but honestly just scaling any type of product from concept to meaningful revenue.

Happy to do a free 30-min product strategy session if it'd be valuable - I like helping fellow Ross folks when I can.

Best,
Luis
