## AUTOMATION IDEAS (Use Your "Cursor" Superpowers)

1. **LinkedIn Automation** (use carefully, don't violate TOS):
   - Phantombuster for connection requests
   - Expandi for message sequences
   - Manual is safer but slower

2. **Job Alert Aggregation**:
   - IFTTT/Zapier to aggregate job posts
   - Google Alerts for company hiring news
   - RSS feeds for job boards

3. **CRM for Job Search**:
   - Notion database for tracking
   - Airtable with automation
   - Google Sheets with Apps Script

4. **Email Tracking**:
   - Mailtrack or similar for sent messages
   - Track opens/clicks on outreach

5. **Portfolio Automation**:
   - Template for quick case study generation
   - Screenshot tool with annotation
   - Quick-share links

---

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

- Don't spam - personalize every message
- Don't lie about experience
- Don't apply to everything - be targeted
- Don't ghost interviews/conversations
- Don't stop networking once you get an offer

## GREEN LIGHTS

- Open to contract-to-hire (mentioned in research as priority)
- Quick start availability (competitive advantage)
- Portfolio with metrics (results-driven)
- Multi-platform expertise (Klaviyo + Omnisend)
- E-commerce specific experience

---

**REMEMBER**: Treat this like a sales pipeline. You need:
- Top of funnel: 100+ outreach messages
- Middle: 20-30 conversations
- Bottom: 5-10 interviews
- Close: 2-3 offers

**The math**: 1-2% of outreach converts to interviews. You need volume + quality.
