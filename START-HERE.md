Subject: Fellow Wolverine - Fractional CPO Question

Hi [Name],

Luis Calderon here - Ross MBA '11. I saw you're at [VC Firm] - [mention something recent/specific].

Quick context: I've been running SketchPop (custom art e-commerce) and scaled it to $3M+ ARR. As we're hitting growth milestones, I'm exploring fractional CPO opportunities to help other founders with the product challenges I've solved.

Given your portfolio focus, curious if any of your companies need strategic product leadership but aren't ready for a full-time CPO?

I've gotten particularly good at e-commerce product strategy and AI integration (recently shipped features at SketchPop that materially moved conversion).

Happy to share what I learned if valuable to your founders.

15-min call this week?

Go Blue,
Luis

## THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER

**Consistency > Intensity**

3-4 hours EVERY DAY beats:
- 12 hours once a week
- Sporadic bursts of activity
- Waiting for motivation

**Block it on your calendar. Treat it like client work.**

---

## WHEN YOU GET STUCK

**"I don't know what to say in outreach"**
→ See templates in LUIS-PERSONALIZED-60DAY-PLAN.md

**"I'm not getting responses"**
→ Follow up after 5-7 days. 90% of results come after follow-ups.

**"I'm overwhelmed"**
→ Just do the TODAY action plan. One day at a time.

**"Is this actually going to work?"**
→ Only if you execute consistently. The plan is solid. You need to work it.

**"I'm too busy with SketchPop"**
→ Then you won't hit 60-90 days. Period. Choose your priority.

---

## FINAL WORD

You asked for a plan. You got one.

You asked for critical feedback. You got it.

You asked for straight talk. You got it.

**Now it's on you.**

The difference between people who land great roles in 60 days vs 6 months is:

**EXECUTION.**

That's it.

**Stop reading. Start executing.**

**Update your LinkedIn headline RIGHT NOW.**
