```
I help high-growth startups and e-commerce brands build products customers love.

As founder of SketchPop LLC, I scaled a custom art e-commerce business to $3M+ in annual revenue through strategic product decisions, AI integration, and relentless focus on customer experience. Currently building the path to $10M.

Before SketchPop: 20+ years leading product, business development, and growth strategy across startups and established companies.

What I bring to fractional CPO & VP Product roles:
• Product Strategy & Roadmapping (0-to-1 and scale-up)
• E-commerce/DTC Growth (Shopify native, $3M+ managed)
• AI Integration & Automation (implemented at SketchPop with measurable results)
• Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO as competitive advantage)
• Team Building & Leadership (hired and managed cross-functional teams)
• Ross MBA (Michigan) - GMAT 720, Top 4%

Available for fractional CPO engagements (15-25 hours/week) or VP Product roles where I can leverage my operator experience to drive measurable results.

Let's connect if you're building something ambitious.

## MENTAL GAME

**Today might feel awkward**. That's normal.

You're:
- Activating a network you haven't used for job search before
- Positioning yourself in a new way (fractional CPO)
- Asking for help

**Remember**:
1. Your Ross network WANTS to help - alumni helping alumni is the culture
2. You HAVE value - you built a $3M+ company
3. This is a numbers game - not everyone will respond, that's OK
4. Consistency beats intensity - 4 hours today is better than 12 hours once this week

**You've got this. Start with Priority 1. Just update that LinkedIn headline.**

**Everything else flows from there.**

## NOTES / REFLECTIONS

[Use this space to jot down thoughts as you work through today]

## CRITICAL REMINDER

**Don't wait until your materials are "perfect."**

- LinkedIn doesn't need to be perfect, just BETTER than it is now
- Your first outreach doesn't need to be perfect, just SENT
- Your tracking doesn't need to be perfect, just FUNCTIONAL

**Version 1.0 shipped today beats Version 2.0 next week.**

**GO.**
