Luis,Calderon,,,"Mar 20, 1978",Fractional CPO & Product Leader | Scaled SketchPop to $3M+ Rev | Product Leader for $1B TurboTax unit | Ross MBA | E-commerce & AI Strategy,"I'm a hands-on product leader who rolls up my sleeves and ships—equally comfortable managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire. Enterprise scale experience, deep AI/ML expertise, and direct cross-functional execution.  At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group PM. Managed 4 PMs while staying hands-on with engineering teams—drove 10-15% CAGR ($100-150M annual growth), coordinated cross-BU product strategy, and personally shipped 4 AI/ML products using human-in-the-loop (HITL) training that served millions of users.  As CEO of SketchPop ($3M revenue, 20% margins), I wear many hats including solo product leader working directly with engineers, plus marketing strategy, operations, and finance. Drove hands-on IC execution: personally deployed AI chatbots (40% cost reduction), rebuilt backend infrastructure, implemented AI-driven workflows. I write specs, work with engineers daily, and ship fast.  I thrive in both leadership and IC roles. Equally comfortable as CEO of a portfolio company (like SketchPop) or managing a product team at enterprise scale (like Intuit)—what matters is shipping great products.  What I bring: • Hands-On Execution: Work directly with engineering teams, write specs, define technical requirements, ship products personally • Enterprise Scale: Led $900M business, but stayed close to code—collaborated with ML engineers on HITL training, API design, system architecture • AI/ML Expertise: Shipped 4 AI products at Intuit before ChatGPT hype, deployed modern LLMs at SketchPop—understand both strategy and implementation • Cross-Functional Leadership: Coordinate across engineering, design, data science, marketing without needing direct reports • Solo Product Leadership: Can be the only product person—SketchPop experience proves I execute without a team • Team Building & Culture: Hire and scale PM teams (did this at Intuit with 4 PMs) while building great product culture  Currently seeking: VP Product, Director Product, or Principal PM roles where I can lead through execution. Open to managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire—I thrive in both. What matters is shipping great products and building great culture.  Ideal fit: Series B-D companies, PE-backed businesses, or established tech companies building AI products. I work best where product leaders code-adjacent and collaborate directly with engineers, and where culture matters.  Location: San Diego preferred, open to remote, willing to travel to LA/SF.",Software Development,92064,"Poway, California, United States","[MrLuisCalderon,VentureFunding,SustainableVC]",[OTHER:http://about.me/LuisCalderon],
