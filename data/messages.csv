Quick intro about myself — I help CEOs reduce taxes, protect their savings, and grow long-term wealth through my Executive Liquidity Blueprint™ — a personalized approach designed to uncover ways to save more and increase what stays in your pocket.    Even with an advisor or plan already in place, many of my clients have still been able to:  – Reduce annual taxes by $25K–$100K+ through smarter income and entity structuring  – Increase how much they’re able to put away each year — without taking on more risk  – Eliminate unnecessary costs or inefficiencies buried in their current setup    With over a decade working with high-income executives, I’ve reviewed hundreds of plans — and almost always find ways to reduce tax exposure, unlock new income strategies, or improve what’s already in place.    A quick 30-minute second opinion might be all it takes to reduce taxes and increase your net worth — worst case, you leave with helpful clarity; best case, we uncover real savings and growth opportunities.

While life insurance is probably the least “fun” tool in the world of financial planning, it’s often the most important because that safety net can prevent the derailing of so many financial goals. Because of this, I wanted to summarize the broad categories of life insurance (specific policies will vary):  1.)  GROUP COVERAGE - Available through employer. Inexpensive. Automatic approval with no underwriting process. Terminates when employment ends.   2.)  TERM COVERAGE - Policy size and premium levels last for a specific period (10, 15, 20 years) then end. Underwriting process required. Not dependent on any employer.   3.)  CASH VALUE COVERAGE - Can be structured to potentially last for life. Underwriting process required. Not dependent on any employer. Builds cash value. May allow for premium contributions to be increased or decreased over the life of the policy. May allow the future death benefit to be used for present long-term care expenses.   Do you feel you have enough resources to provide for your survivors should you pass away?  (Before you purchase, be sure to ask your financial advisor about the life insurance policy’s features, benefits, risks and fees, and whether the life insurance is appropriate for you, based upon your financial situation and objectives. Variable life insurance is a complex investment vehicle that is subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested.) ",INBOX,

These seven essential investment strategies for smarter and more informed investing typically prove helpful:   1.)	THE POWER OF COMPOUNDING. Investing early and often helps remove emotion from investing and helps smooth the ups and downs of the market.   2.)	CONTROLLING EMOTIONS. Follow the investing strategy of “buy low, sell high”. Often people end up doing just the opposite. They buy stocks when they’re expensive and then sell them in a panic when prices drop.   3.)	DOLLAR-COST AVERAGING. Invest a set amount at specific intervals over time. That way, more shares are purchased when prices are low, and fewer shares are bought when prices are high.  4.)	DIVERSIFICATION. Take a broad view of your investments to reduce overall risk in any one area. Whether it’s tax diversification, investment approaches, or time diversification.  5.)	BE AWARE OF RISKS. Becoming educated and being realistic about common risks can help you make an unemotional assessment of just how much risk you’re willing to accept.  6.)	UNDERSTAND YOUR RISK TOLERANCE. Determining whether you’re a conservative, moderate or aggressive investor (or something in between) depends on what kind of gains or losses you’re willing to sustain in any given year.  7.)	REBALANCE. Your investments will shift over time, as some do well, and others don’t. Rebalancing hits the reset button, so the various pieces of your pie are brought back to the sizes you had at the start.  I advise clients in building and managing their investments using all these strategies. Which of the above do you feel you could improve upon?  (Diversification can help protect against certain investment risks but does not assure a profit or protect against loss.)",INBOX,

I’ve been reflecting on the journey — and seeing all you’ve done across growth, product, and AI, I wanted to reach out.  On my end, I’ve been building Koah (tinyurl.com/koahlabs), a startup I co-founded to help GenAI chat publishers earn revenue by enabling advertisers to embed 1:1 sponsored messages directly into live AI conversations — think modern SEM, built natively for AI.  One of our biggest partners is Luzia (luzia.com/en), a GenAI chat app with 50M+ users across Brazil, Spain, and LATAM. It’s mobile-native, GenZ-heavy, and currently seeing 10–12% CTR. We’re already working with brands like Upwork, Cadastra (Unilever), and potentially DoorDash.  Given your sharp eye for product-market fit — and your experience across B2C SaaS and fintech — I’d love to get your take: know anyone who’d be excited to test this AI-native ad channel or explore how it’s evolving?  Either way, hope you’re doing great. And if you’re heading to reunions this fall, would be terrific to reconnect.  Cheers, Kane",INBOX,

Quick background for context: I recently built and sold one of my companies in less than 18 months, growing from $0 revenue to a $50m+ exit. This remarkable growth was powered by focusing on:  Vision: Giving love and attention to the company's vision. Flow: Creating a healthy and happy environment for employees. Surrender: Letting go of subconscious blockers to success.  This approach led to growing from 1 employee to 120 with 0 turnover, all through internal referrals.  Now, I'm looking to form a community of like-minded leaders who are interested in these unconventional but powerful methods. You’re the type of person I’d want to be a part of this community, so I want your opinion…  Is this something that might be of interest to you or your colleagues? Please let me know your first thoughts—I’d really appreciate it!  Looking forward to your thoughts.  Troy Lavinia Co-Founder and CEO",INBOX,

Our fund is designed to provide steady  returns, and we have averaged 7.5% per year for the last 7 years. Our company is registered with the SEC and our managers each have 20 years experience in credit and fixed income investing.  We use proprietary software to select loans we believe represent a good reward/risk balance. We are continually refining and improving our credit tool.  We create provisions of loan losses, which helps ensure that our NAV is not hit with negative surprises.  We have had some down days, but never a down month.  Our track record speaks for itself.  We think the fund is perfect for retirment accounts and medium term savings, where investors want to ensure that when they are ready to draw on their savings they aren't on the wrong side of stock market volatility.    Are you open to a 15 min chat?   Let me know what day/time works for you, or you can book a time with me at https://calendly.com/mlsonenshine   Kind regards,  Michael Sonenshine msonenshine@markitlend.com www.markitlend.com",INBOX,

I know how noisy LinkedIn can be so I wanted to circle back again.   As a 'C-Suite Whisperer' and a ‘Philomath’, I've had the privilege of serving as the trusted advisor to CEOs and other C-Suite executives across organizations of varying sizes, from small businesses to enterprise-level corporations.   I’m curious about what makes these leaders tick - and together we move the needle on their hardest projects and toughest problems that need solving.   I’d love to tell you about some of these wins if you’d like to chat for 15 or so minutes for a quick intro and put a face to the name.  I would be happy to coordinate in a way that’s most convenient for you.   Thank you!  All the best, Digna Kolar, MBA Strategy & Revenue Growth | Global Executive",INBOX,

And it would be great if you could tee up an e-mail intro to the hiring manager. Realistically this sourcing role is not the right level for me, however I would be interested in connecting with the Hiring Leader to better understand the TA org structure and internal client alignment at Intuit.   Here is the intro blurb that you can reference and adjust as needed:  Francisco was most recently with Nike Inc. where he led the Talent Acquisition teams that supported the Converse and Jordan brands and also the North American Geo for Nike. His prior industry experience in TA+DEI includes Financial Services (JPMorgan Chase, American Express), Sports (Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer) and Broadcast Media (Univision and AMC Networks) based in NYC.   For his next move he is focused on TA/DEI/HR COE leadership roles with mission driven companies that engage consumers across the Sports-Media-Entertainment-Lifestyle-Luxury-Fashion-CPG-Tech sectors.   He is focused on NYC metro area based roles with hybrid work schedules but also open to in-office roles. For the right opportunity he will also consider high impact IC roles for example in Executive/Diversity Recruiting. And he would appreciate the opportunity to connect with you to better understand the TA org structure and internal client alignment at Intuit.   LinkedIn Profile:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/festradanyc/ E-mail: Fjestrada@gmail.com",INBOX,

I hope you’ve been well. I believe you’re the hiring manager for a new Head of Product- Growth role? A former colleague of mine, @Luis Calderon would be great for it.  We started the country’s first student-run social venture fund back during our MBA at Michigan and since then he’s gone on to even greater things.  In his words: “With 17+ years of experience, I'm a growth-minded product leader who's managed the design and shipping of software products across industries such as e-commerce, fintech, AI, and subscriptions. At Intuit, my onboarding strategy increased revenue by 9% by creating a better user experience. I drove product strategy for small businesses and self-employed audiences, improving engagement and revenue. My eBay work includes payment solutions, PayPal Credit, optimizing checkout, and improving conversion rates. I'm experienced in leading cross-functional teams, innovative solutions, and achieving outcomes. I was Director of Product Growth at Doctor.com and Ancestry.com, and I was imaginative, data-driven, and design-centric with a customer focus.” ",INBOX,

I have no idea if Michael’s lead gen solution fits into your current plans, or pain points. But, if this is something you are exploring, I can’t say enough good stuff about Michael. Even if this isn't on your radar, I remember my initial conversation with him made me think about things differently, so a conversion might be a good thing.  I'm sure you, like me, are inundated daily with lead gen outsource solutions and promises. I've never found one that delivered. Michael does.  Full Throttle successfully addresses what has become the most painful and expensive piece in a sales driven business...finding qualified leads and making appointments that actually convert. I strongly recommend taking a few minutes to meet with Michael.  He's a good guy, not a hardsell, and will quickly inspire your confidence as he has mine. I hope this is helpful.

The season is going smooth so far (6-0), and I still don’t think we will miss a single game till the end!   My internal disk failed without warning in my MacBook Pro a month ago. As a techie, I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but it taught me some valuable lessons about SSDs. Here are a few tips to share with you:  ✅ Avoid cheap ones. Even if the SSD is a brand name, the controller matters. For USB drives, you should avoid plastic ones, as they don't dissipate heat well.  ✅ Run them periodically. Just leaving them sitting in a safe doesn't help at all. Run them periodically to keep them fresh and to maintain their electromagnetic resilience.  ✅ Migrate to another drive after 5 years. SSDs have a limited lifespan, so it's best to migrate your data to a new drive after 5 years.  ✅ Leave free space. Unlike HDDs, SSDs need free space to perform well and avoid failure. Aim for at least 10%, preferably 20%. Plus, data recovery is almost impossible for most cases.  ✅ Back up, back up, back up! There is no perfect backup solution, but the 3-2-1 approach is a good place to start. This is what I suggest: 1️⃣ Long-term backup (3 to 6 months) to a disk image (Time Machine or Windows Image Backup)  2️⃣ Mid-term backup (1 to 3 months) to an external HDD (not SSD)  3️⃣ Short-term backup (1 week to 1 month) to a cloud storage service  I hope these tips help you to avoid the hassles that I went through. Drop me a line if you're unsure about anything.  Go Blue! Will",INBOX,

I’m a former CEO from the CX industry who now helps PE-backed companies with the management build out part of their investment plans.   Legal practice management SaaS leader AbacusNext has retained us to help them find a best-in-class executive to run their Zola division. I came across your background researching product and business leaders in high growth SaaS environments. What I can’t see from your online profile and would be interested in discussing if you’re up for it, is how much cross-functional operational span of control you’ve had beyond running product.  This exec will own their flagship Zola product, which Abacus acquired last year to be their core next gen practice management cloud platform. The GM will report to the CPXO Jennifer Sherman and will own the P&L, product vision, and go-to-market strategy. We’ve worked with Jennifer on several projects and she is an absolute rock star — highly accomplished, highest integrity, down-to-earth, good sense of humor.   Abacus was acquired by Thomas H Lee in 2021 with a plan to significantly increase market share and better introduce new products to existing install base. The company does $100M revenues today with over 12,000 law and accounting firms as clients.  This is flat out one of the best GM roles we've seen over the last few years. Abacus has a great executive team, investor backing, install base and set of assets — and with Thomas H Lee’s backing they're now swinging for the fences. For an unstoppable builder type, this is the right opportunity to step in, up-level Zola’s product and GTM strategy, and play a key role in a huge success story at AbacusNext.

I’m happy to share. On one hand I could have ramped up on tech a little faster and communicated better but main thing is that Jacobs style is very different than mine. I like to work with the team to derive a solution bottom up and he likes to prescribe the solution and somewhat micromanage. Trying to copy his style and depth in tech was too inefficient for me and a strain of my ability to think about the bigger business picture. He offered a PIP but it would not have made sense in the long run with the wife  back at work and baby getting up 3-4 times a night.  Preventable? I don’t think so. ,INBOX,

Traditional publishing. Where you pitch your book idea to a traditional publishing company and see if they bite. Small royalty payments and loss of creativity control and long timeframes can be some of the downfalls.  2. Self-publishing where you do all of the work and bear all of the costs.  3. Hybrid publishing. Where you pay a fee and outsource the hard work. You can even have the book ghostwritten for you. This is mostly popular with CEO’s, Entrepreneurs, and Celebrities because of their busy schedules.

Reaching out as I'm working on a search: VP Product for Incredible Health: a 2 sided marketplace for healthcare professionals, starting with nurses.   IH is taking on a massive and outdated industry. Healthcare in the US is 3T annually, half of which is spent on labor. Nurse staffing alone is a 34B industry in the US while most facilities are understaffed in nurses. IH is well positioned to own the supply side: every nurse in the US. Already they are the #1 service in the country and >$38M ARR.   This is why Jeff Jordan at a16z led their series A in 2019 and joined the board. He's a leading expert in marketplace businesses, founder of OpenTable, on the boards of Airbnb, Instacart and Pinterest. He knows the incredible potential of a marketplace for healthcare workers and backed IH to win. They are profitable and don't need to raise again.   We're looking for a product and growth expert to help them mature the function and unlock supply side growth. The role leads a team of 5 (growing to 10) and reports to the CEO. Your background is a great fit.   I've attached a one pager with more about the company, team and investors.

And if you or your colleagues need a language translation service, certainly hope to help bring LingoOwl as a resource to improve your costs and speed.  LingoOwl has created a platform that improves the speed and cost of getting high quality, native language translation services. Traditional translation firms operate using a lot of manual project management tasks such as file formatting, negotiating rates, managing documents, timelines, etc. The LingoOwl platform simply automates these manual services enabling local language translation services faster, cheaper but with the same high quality of service.   I have done the cost benefit analysis with other research firms, and in every case so far the LingoOwl platform has been 30-45% cheaper than the costs from traditional providers.  Welcome a chance to reconnect and answer any questions you may have in evaluating whether this resource would be a fit for your language translation needs.  A short presentation about LingoOwl with price comparison can be found here: http://bit.ly/LingoOwl-Overview-and-Pricing  If you are not directly involved with language translation services, then hoping you might connect me to the most appropriate contact.

Hope you're doing well.   I was sad to hear that you thought I was being withholding of information and resources, and you felt like I wasn't willing to let go of control of the team. If I made you feel that way I apologize, and it certainly wasn't my intentions. I wish you would've said something when you started feeling that way rather than me hearing about it after you left. I want to clarify because I was extremely excited for you to start as my boss as I really wanted a mentor and someone to learn about product from. I thought I made that pretty clear right from the start. I wouldn't have cared if you took the entire team because you were my boss and you had every right to do whatever you wanted.  I always treated you with respect, and if it ever felt like I was pushing back on any resources or asking you to reconsider something, it was to protect you from any backlash and to give you the honest feedback you requested. I thought we had a transparent enough relationship where I could be honest with you. Within a couple of weeks, I could tell you were on the radar for pulling a lot of time and resources from many places in the company, and people felt like they weren't able to work on the things that they were previously working on. That was why I gave you feedback on it. I didn't want the first time you were hearing it to be from someone else.   In fact, every time someone complained, I asked for patience as I knew the tough position you were in. It's a difficult job. Even when I was on vacation or over the weekends,  I still took time to answer your questions and jump on calls with you. I tried to include you on as many meetings as possible to the point where you sat in on almost all the meetings I was in. I wouldn't have done that if I wasn't trying to help you succeed at your job.  I really hope you can see that I wasn't your enemy at the company.  By the way, I noticed you left something I'm sure is of meaning to you from your daughter. It's a laminated paper tie. I can ship it to you if you give me your address! Let me know what you want me to do with it.  Best, Allen",INBOX,

I help people explore and educate themselves about different self-sufficiency strategies. Many of my clients are ready to get off the corporate treadmill or are searching for an incremental income stream. Some just feel it's time to steer their own ship but aren't sure where to begin.  I work with my clients to define a vision for their future, identify their transferable strengths and find a way to be truly self-sufficient.  I have a portfolio of a couple hundred options in more than 40 industries.  In short, almost anything you can imagine.  Some clients prefer full-time what others look for a secondary income stream (that they can transition to full time once they feel comfortable that the revenue is coming in).  Please take a look at the recommendations on my profile and my own career background. When is the best time for an introductory call?

I am currently looking for one or two advisors to help our CEO and our Board Chair think through the strategic subscription design for a digital platform we will be launching in the coming months.  You came up in my feed and your experience seems to align with the Boards need. I would like to chat with you about potentially supporting through a voluntary strategic advisory role, perhaps helping our senior executive and leaders think through a support task force design for the Board or simply a short series of meetings that can ensure our CEO gets genuine insight as his team prepares to launch a scalable platform. Should this be of interest I am happy to make the introductions. Though this is not a direct invite to a board seat it would be a meaningful contribution to the boards evolving work, provide you access to a deep professional network of leaders focused on professional access for the American Latino and allow you to list ALPFA among the impressive organizations you have already served. Please take a moment to check out the org at www.alpfa.org and let me know if you are interested so I can make the introductions to our chair and our CEO to start the ball rolling. If I can serve you in any way also do not hesitate to let me know. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.  Daniel@ipartnerships.net if you prefer to connect directly. Thanks",INBOX,

In developing their multi-market platform and IP, the company has partnered with more than 20 leading utilities in four different countries; successfully delivered 9 network market & data projects; and raised $5m non-dilutive funding. Electron's platform is now supporting two live local energy markets (UK & US) with another two in development and a $15m, largely incoming, pipeline. The company is led by energy & flexibility markets expert Jo-Jo Hubbard (11yrs cleantech, expert advisory boards Ofgem & National Grid ESO) and trading platform expert Paul Ellis (30yrs+ founding & running trading platforms, incl. CreditTrade exit). It is now looking for the right funding partner to grow the team; progress its ""service as software"" model to Saas, and set the standard for this $47bn network optimization market.  They have customers in Canada, UK & USA, with 2-3 more territories about to land.   Electron is currently raising a ~1.5 note (agains~15m) - which I suspect will look like a steal in 12-18 months.  Jo Jo is a phenomenal entrepreneur who has hit product-market fit and needs capital now to land & expand.  She is one of the CEO's I coach, and it's a business I'm very confident about.

Our Free Agents work at companies like Amazon, Zoox, Notion, Roblox, Netflix and SpaceX, as well as still-emerging startups backed by A16Z, Sequoia, YC, and USV. Our network spans VCs, executive search, founders, and talent acquisition leaders across sectors + startups. Whatever your goal, we work to help you achieve it.  Just a bit about how it works: we charge 5-9% of your first-year base salary once you accept a new role.

I have a wonderful client in FL- they are an established business that make healthy products for both pets and people. They have been around for several decades and boomed in 2020  They have warehousing/production/sales/distribution/e-commerce/ customer service elements to their business and the technology would need to encompass all these departments.   They are developing a new platform on SiteCore and they would like an in-house technology professional to join their team.   First and foremost- we are seeking a culture fit.   We are seeking someone inquisitive and can get to the root of the technology business needs across different departments. We are seeking someone humble, a visionary, and a team player who is a good communicator and craves feedback from end users.    We are seeking a ""technology pioneer"" who can ensure the company is using technology to their full advantage.  This is not a coding role and this is a role may actually morph and change and the title may not fit in a ""box""  We are seeking someone who has architecture and development experience, someone who is consultative and can also communicate and translate between the ""regular folks"" and the ""tech folks"" and knows how to change their ""language"" depending on who they are talking to. We need someone who can understand, and communicate the needs back to the programmers and developers.   This role can become a bigger role if you like leadership- or it can be an individual contributor in a matrix-based org chart.  This role allows you to be nimble, creative, consultative and also be somewhat autonomous in developing tis technology to meet the business needs.

Here is why I reached out:  I'm the CEO of Third Iron and we sell a service to hospital libraries called BrowZine that allows doctors, clinicians and researchers to browse, read, and stay up to date with medical journals provided by the library. Our tech does a number of things (manage holdings data, institutional authentication requirements, article and linking data) to make finding and getting articles seamless.  In using Doximity, it strikes me that our tech would improve how Doximity get's users to full text, and more (no wonky authentication screens, paywalls, etc).  We externalize our tech via APIs to be integrated in other services - in my industry, with companies like ProQuest, EBSCO and others.  If improving getting to full text in your Newsfeed for Doximity users is of interest, I'd be happy to discuss what we do and how it might be integrated.  No doubt lots of cross over between Doximity users and BrowZine hospital customers.  Let me know what you think, thanks.

Depending on how familiar you are with Slalom and your potential needs, we could:  A. Spend 15-20 minutes on a call, so we can learn more about your role and share a bit about Slalom.  B. Set up a time for us to swing by your offices for a slightly more detailed conversation (if you're at 500 3rd Street, you're a short walk from our offices).  I'll plan to bring with me appropriate practice area leads (call or meeting).  If you had to pick two things that most pique your interest/areas of pain, what would they be:  - Data & Analytics (including reporting, AI, ML, AR...) - Technology Enablement (product innovation/development, security, cloud...)  - Customer Engagement (UX, insights, personas, customer...internal or external ... journeys...) - Operating Model (holistic approach to overall business strategy) - Organizational effectiveness  I don't want to guess or make assumptions on what would be relevant to your current role/challenges.  I want to make sure we wisely invest your time.  Thank you again for the follow-up!  Cheers, Susan 650-208-6464",INBOX,

I came across your profile while leading a search for a Director of Product Management.  Have you heard about Alation? We help companies leverage the full power of their corporate data to make better, faster business decisions. If data fascinates you, Alation is a fantastic place to work.  We’re looking for a highly strategic product leader to have complete ownership of major products, and also to define key priorities for our roadmap.   Would you be open to a conversation?   If you're interested, let’s find a time to talk soon, and see if there's a fit. Please send me your phone number and a few best times to reach you.   Thanks,  Margaret  ----- About Alation:   Our goal is to build a delightful and empowering experience for people who are asking really important questions, the answers to which are not on the internet, but rather are locked away in databases and spreadsheets. We're talking about people like executives at large companies, directors of universities, and leaders in government, as well as researchers and data scientists.  Today, the ""interface"" for getting answers to such questions is to write an email to an analyst, and wait weeks for a response. With Alation, users can find answers in milliseconds.

For background, I'm an independent recruiter with a niche in building founding teams for early stage startups. I've contributed to building the early teams as the first in-house recruiter at Asana and Stripe, and now I'm working on building the early team at PAX Labs. I'm curious if you'd be interested in considering joining our product team in San Francisco. It looks like you've likely gotten up to some interesting things in your career, and it would be great to chat and see if you might enjoy our challenges as well.  At PAX Labs, we believe cannabis can and should be used responsibility, and to that end we're pioneering a new responsible cannabis culture.

I have been part of an ongoing strategic innovation team here at Panasonic for the last year.  During that time we identified several innovations that we could bring to the market - more specifically, we felt that there was a lot of synergy with Tile that we felt we could leverage and provide some additional vectors for your product.  Maybe a little more background, I am Engineering Manager, in our automotive division, responsible for Systems Engineering.  We support all major automotive OEMs globally.  Some of our recent programs include the Ford Sync 3 platform, which I personally was involved, the GM Intellilink, and the Chrysler JD Power winning infotainment systems.  One of the things I am responsible for is integrating technologies into our automotive platform.  With all that said, I'd like to see if you were open to discussions around integrating your product with our various offerings.  I know this is a little light on detail, but I'm very excited to talk about the ways Tile and Panasonic could shake things up.  -Jeff Zellen  Luis Calderon on Feb 4, 12:40 PM ================ Hello Jeff, I'm no longer working for Tile, but can try to connect you with folks that might be able to help you.

I work for Erevena (an executive search firm) and I am engaged on a search for a Product Leader to join the co-founders and other executives at Ladder.  Ladder are changing the way in which people think about life insurance and doing away with the old and broken nature of the industry. They are creating a product that is powered by AI/ML data modeling grounded by a customer experience that is as adaptable as life itself changes. Their view that life insurance should involve a more complete view of health encompassing both the mental and physical along with allowing for financial flexibility.   This role will involve working with the team of co-founders with this person being the most experienced in the product function. Ladder's goal of rethinking the customer experience within the insurance industry is a something that the product function will have to use a fair amount of creative thinking and evaluation.  Now I don't mean to assume you are actively looking, but given your background I thought this might be something worth having a chat about if it piqued your interest.  Ladder's website if wish to look into them: https://www.ladderlife.com  Hope to hear back soon. Best,   Philip Gundy  +1(415)244-7190 | Philip.Gundy@erevena.com",INBOX,

You know the funny thing about Caitlin? She ended up choosing Tuck over Ross! I almost never ""link in"" with people who don't choose Ross, but she got me! I honestly don't remember her / don't know her well, but could connect you with Rossers at Deloitte who might know her / might be able to make an intro - would that help?  And I miss you! I haven't done a big event in SF in a little while and the young bucks are always pretty eager, so I snap them up when I can get 'em. That said, I'll be back in SF in late March for a different event and would love to get the crew together if we can.  All the best, and Go Blue!

I came across your profile while leading a search for a Director of Product Management.  Have you heard about Alation? We help companies leverage the full power of their corporate data to make better, faster business decisions. If data fascinates you, Alation is a fantastic place to work.  We’re looking for a highly strategic product leader to have complete ownership of major products, and also to define key priorities for our roadmap.   Would you be open to a conversation?   If you're interested, let’s find a time to talk soon, and see if there's a fit. Please send me your phone number and a few best times to reach you.   Thanks,  Sonam  ----- About Alation:   Our goal is to build a delightful and empowering experience for people who are asking really important questions, the answers to which are not on the internet, but rather are locked away in databases and spreadsheets. We're talking about people like executives at large companies, directors of universities, and leaders in government, as well as researchers and data scientists.  Today, the ""interface"" for getting answers to such questions is to write an email to an analyst, and wait weeks for a response. With Alation, users can find answers in milliseconds. And if the question requires human analysis, we empower the analyst to produce a report in minutes, not months.  We're a small team, already solving enormous data challenges, with big customers and big goals. We have Series B funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz; our customers include eBay, Square, Albertsons, and many others.

We all have more and more ways to share, yet sometimes the most meaningful moments - and the most meaningful people in our lives can slip through our fingers in a sea of more frivolous content. In an effort to create ways to truly commemorate what matters, Fuel (fuelyouth.com) has built a simple mobile tool that helps people express themselves by sourcing a new type of meaningful User Generated Content (UGC) to share with friends and family.   From wedding parties, baby showers, bar mitzvahs, to memorial services - there are moments that are made more special when we can capture the energy and words of our friends and family - and the heartfelt and interesting words but often, we are swept up in the moment. Capturing the legacy of loved ones matters, and giving a voice to the elderly and less digitally savvy is crucial to ensuring their important perspectives don’t go unexpressed and forever lost in time.   Our CEO, Mike Burns would love to provide a demonstration of the technology and see if there’s an opportunity to partner and create a powerful campaign that will let your audience use this technology to share deeper, more touching moments with the world and their loved ones.   Please let know when you’re available to connect.    Thank You,    Monica Mellado  mmellado@fuelyouth.com",INBOX,

We use CJ (Commission Junction) at Ancestry as an affiliate platform. We've partnered with them for forever and they work with a lot of large advertisers. We're looking into potentially switching to an SaaS tool but that's specifically because CJ isn't set up well to manage partners (which is why we manage them separately). The company we're looking into for that is called Performance Horizon.

We are hiring a Senior Product Marketing Manager and think you would be an incredible fit for the role.   Here’s some quick background on Qualtrics and the opportunity:   Financially, Qualtrics is unique and stable. We have been cash flow positive since inception. In other words, we have a sound business that isn't reliant on marketing timing or investment to continue our rapid growth.     We started in a basement, bootstrapped for 10 years before finally accepting funding. Our $70M Series A was Sequoia and Accel’s largest joint investment to date. With our $150M Series B from Sequoia, Accel and Insight Venture Partners we became Accel’s largest investment since Facebook. We have over 8,500 enterprise clients in more than 90 countries. Qualtrics has 1,100 employees in offices around the world including Dallas, Provo, Seattle, Dublin, London, Sydney, and Melbourne.     I would love to schedule a call between you and Jay Choi, our head of product marketing and content, who can speak with you more about the opportunity. Would you be open to having a conversation? Please let me know.  Here is some recent news relating to Qualtrics:    http://www.businessinsider.com/enterprise-startups-to-bet-on-in-2016-2015-11 http://www.businessinsider.com/success-of-qualtrics-jared-smith-2016-4 http://fortune.com/2016/02/18/qualtrics-insights-platform/ http://fortune.com/2015/04/21/ryan-smith-changing-careers    Cheers,   Eliza Goldhardt elizag@qualtrics.com",INBOX,

Given that at any point in time about 80% of LinkedIn members are not evaluating new career opportunities, chances are you're very happy where you are and enjoying life there but still thought I should reach out to see if you might have an interest in coming to play for us.  If you like Madonna movies then I'd say something like we're ""Desperately Seeking Someone"" to join our Product Marketing team to help us to continue to innovate on both existing and new yet to be determined products.  It's a chance to have a big impact on our business.  We’re poised for some fairly explosive growth in 2016 from a revenue, systems and employee perspective and having the right Marketing folks in place is essential.  Would love to connect if you are at all intrigued.   Slán go Fóill  Owen  289-921-7818 | omanley@fitbit.com",INBOX,

I have been part of an ongoing strategic innovation team here at Panasonic for the last year.  During that time we identified several innovations that we could bring to the market - more specifically, we felt that there was a lot of synergy with Tile that we felt we could leverage and provide some additional vectors for your product.  Maybe a little more background, I am Engineering Manager, in our automotive division, responsible for Systems Engineering.  We support all major automotive OEMs globally.  Some of our recent programs include the Ford Sync 3 platform, which I personally was involved, the GM Intellilink, and the Chrysler JD Power winning infotainment systems.  One of the things I am responsible for is integrating technologies into our automotive platform.  With all that said, I'd like to see if you were open to discussions around integrating your product with our various offerings.  I know this is a little light on detail, but I'm very excited to talk about the ways Tile and Panasonic could shake things up.  -Jeff Zellen",INBOX,

I am a firm believer of networking and that a career break through opportunity always begins with a conversation.  The next couple of years mark a new phase in VMware's product innovation.  Just as we defined and are the leader in virtualization, we are now on the brink of leadership in Software-Defined Data Center. Your profile fits the kind of superior marketing talent that we are looking for.      Why work for SDS GTM:     - You are a results delivery machine  - You’re a re-seller/VAR partner Go-to-Market wunderkind  - You're an operations, technology marketing extraordinaire  - You’re awesome at presenting to clients and partners  - You get a jolt from rolling up your sleeves to build successful joint marketing assets, enablement and readiness programs   - You’re the kind of person that doesn’t wait to be told what to do, and are hungry to get in on the ground floor of VMware’s next great growth business       What are your thoughts on taking that next step? Please let me know how you would like to proceed, including your availability and the best way to contact you.    Thank you and I look forward to your reply!

Send me a blurb with relevant b/g and I will ping the CEO.     We've raised about $1.7MM from angels, and are working with a handful of beta customers to develop our SaaS offering. The best description of our business is the following write up:    Companies traditionally invest heavily in customer acquisition, but over time, do not get their fair share of follow-on sales opportunities.  A big deterrent is the relatively low ROI, mostly driven by the cost of lead identification and qualification. As a result, companies leave a lot of profitable revenue on the table because the pain points associated with identifying and following up on lower ASP sales.     Entytle, Inc. is a predictive data analytics company building software as a service (SaaS) to help B2B companies identify high probability follow-on sales opportunities.  We use analytics and machine learning applied to companies' enterprise-wide “dark data” to identify these opportunities within their existing customer base.  The solution will help companies maximize the lifetime value of their customer base by selling additional products and services such as upgrades, replacements, cross-sales, consumable parts replacement, service contract renewal, etc.     We generate actionable leads and populate them back into the CRM of choice. Our value proposition is simple: dramatically reduce the time and cost it takes to generate a qualified lead, increase the size of the served available customer base, and improve conversion rate of leads into quotes and orders.

We made the move to Encinitas last week, getting  settled in here and starting to get serious about the job search too. I've been working with a coach from LHH outplacement here in SD, she is awesome. They have a whole 10-step program that I think is pretty solid and likely to generate interviews. Not sure if the SJ office does the same program, you should look into it though. (to be honest, the LHH operation in SD is far superior than SJ office...)  I'm on step 1-2 of the job search program, which inludes resume, CL and LI profile updating. Creating a new CL and resume, and working on beefing up my LI profile. Will likely start applying and networking seriously in the next week. Looking for PM, customer experience, and marketing roles in tech. Saw Uber is expanding in SD, thinking about applying with them. Otherwise, excited to start networking to find whats available here beyond the big guys.  What's your status? Need any help?  Cheers- Bmoss   ",INBOX,

I wanted to make you aware of an opportunity in the area that I feel is worthy of your time- even If you're not looking at this time. That said, I did want to see if you might be willing to help me with one of my newer clients, as your security experience is so relevant to what they're looking for.    I'm currently working with a Comcast Ventures portfolio firm that just raised $8M during a Series A investment (they didn't necessarily need funds, and were already extremely profitable). They are a software product company that morphed from a consultancy to deliver security and big data analytics solutions to half of the Fortune 100. They made quite a few strategic connections early on and even though they are around 30 employees right now, are set to explode. They're looking for people that will be invested in growing their company.    One of the roles in particular I was wondering if you might be able to help me with is a Technical Program Manager position. They have an enterprise clientele base of 30+ Fortune 100 clients including JP Morgan, Accenture, and SunTrust to give you an example. This role, while a TPM, is much more than that. It's someone that needs to have the mentality of a partner of the firm. Their accounts are relatively large - $3M in scale, so there's quite a bit of meat on the bone.    We are looking for a TPM to oversee the enterprise implementations. You will be responsible for working with cross-functional teams to build out technically sound, value driven service offerings and You will be expected to simultaneously oversee multiple services projects.    Thank you so much in advance for your help! I'll be happy to speak further if this piques your interest.    Katie D. Smith  Katie@ehire.com  4049903308",INBOX,

I have agreed to help the founder/CEO of Shipwire, Damon Schechter, do some friends and family networking to try and locate a couple of world-class business strategists to join his Innovations Labs in Sunnyvale, CA.  His company got bought by Ingram Micro in December of last year, and Ingram has chartered Damon with building an incubation lab to generate new business ideas for Ingram to fold into their vast distribution network...or spin off as private entities.  With a $15M VC investment, Shipwire rose to the top of the competition, and made their market a two horse race (Shipwire versus Fulfillment by Amazon), ultimately leading to the acquisition of Shipwire by Ingram Micro, a Fortune 100 company.   Damon intends to hire two-person ideation prototyping teams, and have these teams sell their ideas to both Damon and the CEO of Ingram Micro. Great ideas may be spun off, so this could very well be analogous to the standard Silicon Valley E.I.R. model where the idea crafter becomes a principal in this new business venture.  I'm looking for an educational pedigree like yours with some ""top 10"" mgmt. consulting or program management experience. 2-5 years eCommerce or web services product management experience is also coveted. Venture capital experience is a real plus as well.  Would you be open to a brief chat when I get the JD refined? ...or would you be open to referring me to some clones of yours in your network?

Things just got incredibly hectic those last few weeks.     Yep, we've changed directions pretty dramatically on the startup. (Thanks for signing up for the beta, by the way.)    So here's the story: a few months ago, as we were still working on our digital publishing concept, we began working on a concept in the healthcare (or ""healthtech"", a now-popular term) space. Ultimately, we decided to put the publishing concept aside for now in favor of the healthcare concept.     This new concept is based on the idea that more and more people are trying to actively manage their own health, but many, if not most, people can't access and just don't understand their personal health data - at least not in a way that allows them to act upon this information and make better decisions about their health.     One major area where this personal health data is extremely confusing is medical tests, even seemingly basic ones. What we're trying to do with LuminateHealth is build a solution to make important indicators of overall health, such as the common blood test, more accessible and digestible for patients. Our initial approach is to provide clear graphics, visualizations, and explanations, so that patients can make better decisions about their health. And as part of this solution, we're also working to give patients direct access to their clinical data from various sources to allow them to manage, track, and selectively share it electronically.     Would love to get your thoughts on it too if you're around to chat in more detail this coming week. Let me know if you've got some time during the second half of the week. We can chat over the phone or via Skype.    How are things on your end? How's the family? And how are things at Accenture and with other projects you might be working on?    Let's catch up,    Sidd      ",INBOX,

I’m in the process of identifying a new career opportunity and I’d like to know if you might think about me as you network with your contacts?  I know it’s a lot to ask…thanks for considering.      Ideally, I am searching for a role in Corporate Finance (FP&A) or working directly with/for an Operating Division that may need help managing their P&L.  I have a very strong background in finance & accounting.  I'm really good at helping non-technical finance people understand how their operating functions impact the financial statements.     Meanwhile, I am trying to find consulting work (1099 Contractor) using my skills in finance, accounting, contracts and project management where I help companies manage their projects.  I think of this as a Project Controller with functions in project budget development & management, contract negotiation & change order management, accounting entries- invoices, reconciliation and auditing.  This would also include the integration point between the company, project owner, project implementation team, contractors and consultants.      If you can think of a company or someone who could benefit from these services, I would be thankful for an introduction.       Thanks for considering.  Have a great day!    James Masias",INBOX,

It’s no longer just about a Day.    The time has arrived for the world to come together in equilibrium for all 365 days a year.    We’ve lived through the Great Depression and the Great Recession- it’s now time for the Great Recalibration.    A reversion to GOOD. A return to common sense.    In fact, a full embrace of social, financial and environmental sustainability represents not only the best possible economic opportunity for this century, but it is also the natural & correct thing to do.    Not to mention the only thing that will save our planet.    You see: we simply don’t possess the right to mortgage our social, financial and environmental future to pay for the vanities of the present. We simply don’t possess the right to disrespect our fellow human beings, animals or planet.    Our mission is clear: we are obliged to leave the world in better condition for our children- who powerfully represent the future before our very eyes.    Hyper-consumption is dead. Collaborative consumption is in.    Hyper-individualism is out. Community is in.

My company specializes in identifying key markets with strong economic indicators to source off-market, distressed properties with significant equity. We provide capital that covers 80% of the project costs for the purchase and renovation of those properties and then we partner with people like you on the balance of the project and share in profits on every property.

I’m reaching out today to see if we can schedule a 15 to 30 minute call to discuss our programs with you and see if we may have a potential fit.  Our process tends to work best with individuals who are interested in real estate, busy with work or a company, like the idea of having real estate done for them, and have reserves available for good investments.  I can’t tell if we are a good fit, so please do let me know either way.   Have you considered, or are you already, investing in Real Estate?   If you are interested, let’s schedule a quick call.

I am using the group open messaging system as I thought this topic may be of interest to you directly.    I wanted to share a new members’ only portal powered by CrowdFundConnect for entrepreneurs and accredited investors within the health industry and invite you to our network.    Since 2005, our partner Healthios has participated in 65 transactions worth more than $9 billion of invested capital throughout the global healthcare industry as a FINRA/SEC registered broker dealer.    The market has changed over the past 15 years. A new law was enacted in 2012 to assist companies in gaining access to capital, the JOBS ACT. It is currently being implemented by the SEC with some sections already complete. Over time, this will open new avenues of funding for companies from seed to exit using either private equity or new ways to IPO at lower costs with less regulatory burden on the issuer.    Healthios is at the forefront of implementing new funding opportunities under the existing regulations and will quickly implement new funding options as the SEC completes the framework for a full suite of new options to allow companies to access equity investors.    We would love to have you as a participant in our members’ only funding portal – HealthiosXChange.com.  You can join here - www.healthiosxchange.com/signup and by using my referral code we will automatically connect there.

In the long term, I want to work as a strategy consultant and become an industry expert. Realistically speaking, I have neither any direct experience to steer my career towards strategy consulting nor an Ivy league b-school MBA degree.  As per my understanding of the strategy field, a profile in analytics could be my immediate step to take my career in the right direction, towards the long term goal. May I please know your opinion on my understanding?    Next question would be about, What do you see in a recent MBA graduate for analytics roles? How can I prepare myself better for such roles. As some preliminary preparation, I have been studying data analysis concepts like, Hypothesis testing, regression, ANOVA, factor and cluster analysis, along with tools such as SPSS, MS Excel.   It would be a great help for me if you decide to guide. If you prefer having a call, rather than responding though mail, please let me know, I would give you a call.   Appreciate your help and time.

Robert was very knowledgeable about the market and was incredibly responsive to our needs.  He always made himself available us at a moments notice during all hours of the day to answer almost any question or to find someone that could help.  He's well connected in the area and has extremely good reputation with other service providers.  He's also an incredible trustworthy person and helped us make difficult personal decisions.  He truly earned his fee twice over and I would recommend him to any new or old buyer that would like keep the transaction as simple as possible with the least amount of stress.""

We are developing and running various websites, and we develop/sell few products also. (e.g Timesheet script http://qualitypointtech.net/webtimesheet/index.php ).    Apart from our own products, we plan to do custom development for our customers. Let me know if you are interested to use this opportunity.    We can do any kind of web development(php/myslq/html/jquery/ajax) for affordable price. (just $6 per hour of work)    Personally, I have around 15 years of experience in IT. And, I am running QualityPoint Technologies for more than 5 years.    So, our Team can do any custom script development effectively in a professional way.    And, If you are interested in our software testing service, refer http://qualitypoint.blogspot.in/2012/12/software-testing-for-success-of-it.html for more details.    I came to know that lot of people are having some good online business ideas and they have enough resources for marketing also. But they hesitate to start their business as they were thinking that web development cost will be more. But the fact is, we can get lot of free open source scripts available online and they can be made suitable for our needs by doing some code changes. So our custom web development services will be suitable for these kind of people who want to start their own online business. You may refer our script development service to your friends who will be interested to start their own profitable business.    Please let me know if you have any questions.

That vision has evolved over the last 8 years into something much bigger than I ever could have imagined - the opportunity to use the big data that we're all generating every day as we interact with various systems as the catalyst to motivate, engage, and drive true loyalty among our customers, employees, and partners.   At Bunchball we've been living this vision since 2007, when we created the gamification industry, and we've spent the last six years perfecting the art and science of data-driven motivation. We believe that this is the future, and now we want to share it with the world.   In a few weeks, our book ""Loyalty 3.0: How to Revolutionize Customer and Employee Engagement with Big Data and Gamification"" comes out. We recently found out that if we can get 11,000 copies ordered before June 18th, the book will debut on the NY Times Bestseller list. Being on a list like the NY Times has become crucial in building momentum for books and their ideas, especially for first time authors like myself. We are actually well on our way with some large bulk purchases and it is within reach, but we need some help to get us the final mile.   The number one thing you can do to help right now is to pre-order the book (hardcover or ebook) from one of the following retailers:  - Amazon.com: http://bit.ly/Loyalty30A - BN.com: http://bit.ly/Loyalty30B  I would love your support, whether it is:  - Pre-ordering 1, 3, 10 or more books today. We're even offering bonus material if you order before June 18th: http://bit.ly/Loyalty30Bonus - Introducing me to someone that could blog about Loyalty 3.0 - Talking about the book on Facebook and Twitter (#gamification #loyalty30) - Introducing me to an employer that may be able to bulk buy books - Or by forwarding this message to ten people you know who are struggling with how to motivate their customers, partners, or employees, and asking them to pre-order. The book will actually really help.   Write me and let me know any other ideas you have! We believe that these ideas are critically important to the future of business, and we really need your help to get them out there.  Thank you for your friendship and support, rajat   btw - here are a few of the endorsements that people were kind enough to write about the book:   ""Loyalty 3.0 is filled with major insights, and does a brilliant job of grounding the reader in fundamental concepts around motivation, big data, and gamification - building on these concepts through real-world case studies that bring the combinations to life – and finishing with actionable ideas and next steps that enable you to test and operationalize these ideas in your own workplace and personal life."" - Brad Smith, President & CEO, Intuit   ""Relationships are the single greatest asset for all organizations. Relationships with customers, relationships with employees, relationships with partners. In Loyalty 3.0, Rajat Paharia reveals the new science of relationship building through big data and gamification."" - Tim Brown, CEO, IDEO  ""Rajat Paharia comprehensively explains how to create loyalty in the modern world full of data and connectivity. If you want to learn how to motivate and inspire employees, you must read this book.” - Dave Kerpen, New York Times bestselling author of Likeable Social Media and Likeable Business ",INBOX,

As a former management consultant, entrepreneur, and product marketer, I would like to leverage my 12+ years of experience with product development, marketing, and strategy to help an organization develop software products and take them to market to drive new growth.    Throughout my career, I have founded several companies and consulted for large and small clients during which I have developed products from concept to launch, gathered competitive and market intelligence, segmented customers, managed inbound & outbound marketing, and helped enable sales.  During these experiences, I learned how to best deliver to customer's needs, understand market dynamics, build dynamic customer-driven solutions in order to realize a strategic product vision.    I feel strongly that my background is a good match to this role.  If interested, I can forward you a CV.    Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you!

I had the privilege of working with Luis for over a year. He has an incredible ability to execute that most aren't able to in the highest standard of quality. Luis is a unique individual who understands deeply in both technology and business. While I worked with Luis on Bebarang, he has proved himself to be a great leader, mentor, and a dear friend.   What I respect him the most, however, is his personal humility and character. I haven't come across a guy like Luis with such generosity and respect in treating others.   I'd highly recommend him to anyone looking to focus their efforts in a team-player for technology development, strategic planning, and business development. I have full confidence in Luis to be capable of delivering any task at hand.""  ",INBOX,

We are a young, diverse group of entrepreneurial biochemists and public health scientists who have developed and patented an innovative, scalable system capable of mass producing fresh, organic fruits and vegetables using reclaimed freshwater from aquaculture systems or fish farms. The recycled water comes from adjoining fish culture tanks or ponds, and is filtered via the platform biotechnology, where no soil is required to grow value-added plant products such as tomatoes.    Our prototype, tentatively called the BioColumn, has been intimately engineered and refined over the past five years. Our technology is based on a novel, zero-discharge technology called aquaponics. We are interested in securing a strategic partnership with a local entities to support and fund the model. We have an executive summary and business plan available outlining the strong commercial potential of the BioColumn and horizontal growth opportunities for the organization.

Based on the exceptional things we have heard in regards to you as a professional and your exemplary background, I had hoped that you may be open to engaging in an “exploratory” phone conversation with me. I understand that you are hit up by recruiters left & right and I want to be mindful of that; however, my intention is not to sell you a bill of goods, but rather break the ice and get further acquainted.    I would like to understand what it is that drives you professionally and what your long-term aspirations are as it pertains to your career. In addition, I want to share the Slalom story and our goals moving forward in 2012. I truly hope you will take me up on my offer to chat and I look forward to hearing back from you in the coming days. Please know that I am willing to speak with you at your convenience, even if that means connecting after work hours. Have a nice afternoon.",INBOX,

I know you guys don't have a whole lot of extra cash, so I'm willing to do it for free upfront, as long as you're doing a significant amount of online advertising (facebook, adwords, etc.)  and keeping track of conversions and other analytics (we would want to use your video as a use-case). Based on my experience you could see a huge upswing in conversions. The video we made for Homeschool Advantage increased their sign-ups from 8% to 43%.     If you're interested I just need a couple vector graphics from you guys (logo, etc.) and I'll have a first cut for you to look at in a week.    Give me a call and lets talk.

I wanted to let you know about the latest and greatest Veteran-focused service that provides some of the things you have been looking for when you probably joined LinkedIn. Read the article from Lee Kelley and Join the movement!    by leekelley    We live in a world of social networking… and considering the amount of people on Facebook, Linkedin, and now Google+, we must think it’s pretty cool.  Well, I recently learned about an exciting new community for vets. It’s called Armedzilla, and it seems to share elements from all of these social networks, while creating a unique experience for vets and organizations that provide services and support to vets.    In other words, they are all about vets, and we like that!    Here’s an excerpt from their site:    ArmedZilla is a social network. But it’s more than that. ArmedZilla is a movement around fundamentally changing our connection with America’s armed forces by creating a social platform that’s never existed before. It’s a never-ending conversation you control based on your own unique needs and interests that will help you gain direct access to the opportunities you deserve.  Specifically, ArmedZilla was designed to rally veterans, service members, families, friends and supporters around:    •	finally bringing the military community together in one secure place;  •	creating a support community to help ease transition from service into civilian life and “mainstream” culture;  •	using the power of social media to provide better access to veteran benefits, veteran service organizations (VSOs) and veteran-centric brands and other entities that support them;  •	showing pride in and public recognition for military service contributions;  •	connecting with people, issues and causes our community deems important.  –  Okay, so I hope you can see why I like this site so much. But I haven’t even told you about my favorite part… it’s called “Keypoints.” You can put in keypoints to create a visual history of your military experiences.    You can populate each keypoint with pictures and text, telling everyone your story from that time in your life. When they hover over the keypoints, they get a preview of what’s in there, or they can click on it to read more. This was so much fun, and I really enjoyed creating my own keypoints. It brought back a lot of good (and some not so good) memories.    Finally, Armedzilla has a growing number of “channels” from various non-profits and businesses geared toward the veteran community.    We’re always looking for great new tools and resources for vets, and I’d say keep your eyes on Armedzilla!    Join, it's Free! - https://armedzilla.com/register",INBOX,

Honestly, I just am looking for some advice from someone who does management consulting, and I don't personally know but one person in the field.     I actually just completed my first year in a PhD program in social psychology, and I've realized that this isn't what I want to be doing. Long story short, the job opportunities are extremely bleak and it's a long path to even be able to apply for the few opportunities. Also, I'm a very people-oriented person which can sometimes be disheartening when I spend 60 hours/week working on research in a basement with no people or windows.     I entered the field because I like statistics and psychology, but now I'm realizing that I've completely ignored my strength in actual human interactions (as in, not just looking at data points of various people). Anyway, I've been researching potential jobs, and management consulting seems to be of interest. The only problem is that I have no idea what it takes to enter a career in management consulting or where to start. I have a minor in business, but besides that I just have a bunch of psychology research experience to show for the past couple of years. I'm hardworking and will do what it takes to get there, but I honestly have no idea where to begin.    You seem to be successful in business, so alas, I turn to you for help. How did you get to be where you are, and where did you start? Is there any advice you could give me on management consulting?    I apologize for the random email from a stranger asking for advice, but if you have the time I would greatly appreciate any information you could provide.     All the best,    Marlea",INBOX,

Philanthropists have been energized by stories and research that detail the profound impact of investing in women and girls. However, the world of financial services offers few vehicles that enable women and allies to move significant investment assets toward generating the Women Effect. Women Effect Investments (WEI) is a field-building initiative of Criterion Ventures that seeks to shape the financial markets to positively impact women and girls.    October’s Convergence gathering - http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/779479/d502c185f3/505769549/f932428228/ - confirmed our belief that the moment is now for gender lens investing.  We saw existing opportunities crystallize and new ones emerge as leaders engaged across the ecosystem.  The momentum was tangible – and so was the sense that we are still early.  We emerged with a renewed commitment to continue to share stories, data and ideas.  We also found many shared priorities and tangible ways to work together to move investing with a gender lens forward – and improve conditions for women and girls on a global scale.    Join us in our Gender Lens Investing Forum - http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4095944&trk=myg_ugrp_ovr - a Linked In group, to continue the sharing, the collaboration, and the dialogue. This is a space for leaders interested in investing with a gender lens – investors, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, development professionals, gender experts, and more.  The work of WEI is creating and strengthening both a set of engaged investors and a set of investment vehicles with a gender lens. This forum seeks to connect those who share these goals.",INBOX,

The world has changed, whether we like it or not. But where exactly are we going?     In his State of the Union Address tonight, President Obama spoke about reinventing America to compete in this new world, about investing in innovation to move our country and our economy forward.     Green entrepreneurs are bound to be a central part of this new innovation economy but not just because the government says so.     The future of business is green because it makes fundamental sense on every level.     The innovation economy is a green economy and entrepreneurs everywhere are already busy building it.     They are already hard at work developing clean fuels, clean energy, good food, and other innovations that are both good for business and good for the environment.     Green business is not just a luxury, and not just for polar bears.     Green business is good business, as the sustainability innovators like Gary Hirshberg at Stonyfield Farm, Janine Benyus at the Biomimicry Institute, and Ray Anderson at Interface have demonstrated over and over again.     By cutting waste, polluting less, and using nature as a business model the green business leaders have show that making money and making a difference can go hand in hand.     Some clear goals were laid out by the President, detailing the new direction we should move toward.     President Obama proposed that we place a million electric cars on the road by 2015, and that 80% of our power should be generated from clean sources by 2035. We could argue about the details, and I'm sure we will, but these sound like worthy goals.     What's more important than the numbers or the specific path that we take to reach them is the vision that we can work together to create an economy that is both strong and sustainable.     The world is loaded with problems that urgently need solutions and entrepreneurs across the country are already hard at work delivering these solutions, building great businesses along the way.     As the founder of Rent a Green Box, Spencer Brown has built a profitable business by supplying eco-friendly boxes made from recycled plastic for those who are moving.     Not only does his business save trees and reduce landfill waste, but it saves people money and makes moving day easier.     As the founder of the EcoHub in San Diego, Yeves Perez is building a space where green companies work and grow together, finding common ground in their shared vision of an economy that is both green and strong.     James Cass in Las Vegas has worked for years developing the Mojave Breeze as an innovative air cooling technology which will save people money as well as saving the planet.     Milan Stevanovich in Michigan is developing Local Power using technology developed by Hardin Geothermal to create local utilities that extract energy from the ground with geothermal heat pump systems, helping cities and power consumers as well as reducing our reliance on dirtier and more expensive forms of energy.     Change is inevitable, but we have the power to decide what kind of change we want to see. I hope we can agree that we all want to create a strong economy with good jobs and a better cleaner world for today and for the future.     If so, these fundamental connections should prove stronger and more resilient than the political differences that sometimes drive us apart. A move toward an innovative and greener economy that creates good jobs, strong businesses, and a healthier world sounds to me like the right direction for us all.     Glenn Croston is the author of 75 Green Businesses and Starting Green, and the founder of Starting Up Green, helping green businesses to tell their stories that change the world.",INBOX,

Lucked into the environmental field, but it's something that's pretty important, I feel.  Plus, rare is the individual in the enviro field (or at least that used to be the case) that has a business and efficiency view of the process.

Please share with friends, colleagues, classmates who might be interested in applying.     The initial hiring plan will include the following roles:     *   Human Factors  Specialist with a minimum of 3 years of experience   *   Interaction Designer with excellent visual design skills and a minimum of 3 years of experience   *   Communication Designer with a minimum of 3 years of experience   *   Industrial/Product Designer with a minimum of 3 years of experience   *   Business Development Lead with strong operational experience (see job description below) and a minimum of 5 years of experience    To read more about the positions and apply, please visit http://www.ideo.com/culture/careers/.     The Business Development position is not yet posted, so if you're interested in that one (description below), please email Natasha directly at ngibson@ideo.com    ________________________________    POSITION SPECIFICATIONS  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LEAD, IDEO INDIA    ORGANIZATION AND CULTURE      Founded in 1991, IDEO is an innovation and design firm that uses a human-centered, design-based approach to help organizations in the business, government, education, healthcare, and social sectors innovate and grow in three ways: Identify new ways to serve and support people by uncovering their latent needs, behaviors, and desires; Visualize new directions for companies and brands and design the offerings - products, services, spaces, media, and software - that bring innovation strategy to life; and Enable organizations to change their cultures and build the capabilities required to sustain innovation.    IDEO is known both externally and internally, for its unique culture.  As the company describes on its website: “…our culture is 20+ years in the making. Compound that number by the hundreds of people who have contributed over the years and you get a special mix. Our values are part mad scientist (curious, experimental), bear-tamer (gutsy, agile), reiki master (hands-on, empathetic), and midnight tax accountant (optimistic, savvy). These qualities are reflected in the smallest details to the biggest endeavors, composing the medium in which great ideas are born and flourish…”  As a result of the IDEO’s unique culture, IDEO recognizes that one of the greatest challenges to bringing in strong leadership and team members is identifying people who can intuitively understand, integrate, and thrive within this unique professional community.    IDEO views people as its biggest asset.  The Firm describes the human cultural value driver as being “T-shaped”.  The vertical is a deep creative craft, a special talent or expert skill, the horizontal a curiosity to learn, an ability to understand and respect the knowledge of others and a collaborative and open mind.    IDEO thrives on peer relationships rather than hierarchies; on teams rather than lone thinkers.  It is fiercely protective of its open collaborative approach and believes it is the key enabler for the firm to deliver innovative, groundbreaking work.    At present, IDEO has just over 520 employees worldwide situated in 8 offices globally. IDEO is opening their new office in Mumbai, India in 2011. They are looking to hire talented and passionate designers to work on a range of projects in corporate, social and public sectors. Candidates will come from various fields and will include disciplines such as industrial and product design, interaction design, human factors, business design, communication design, service systems, environments design and more. We are looking to hire 6-8 people between June and December 2010. These people will begin their IDEO career in one of our global locations (US, UK or Shanghai) for a period of approximately 3 months before joining the IDEO-India team in Mumbai.    POSITION SUMMARY      The Business Development Lead will support the efforts of the organization in India, and by extension, Asia-Pacific, to drive the development, client relationship, and project scoping that “make sense” for the IDEO to take on.  This entails understanding IDEO’s “sweet spot” in terms of leveraging its greatest assets, while also understanding the commercial dynamics that enable projects to meet both revenue and profitability targets.      MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES    ·      Serves as a contributing member of IDEO’s global business development team.    •      Collaborate with location leadership team and the design community to develop a compelling offer of IDEO’s business value to new clients through their specific area of need.    •      Build strong and sustainable relationships with clients.    •      Find and realize new business opportunities for IDEO within the client organization.    •      Understand IDEO’s positioning and specific needs within their organization.    •      Understand IDEO’s organizational set up for implementation, and how it impacts the project and the Firm.    •      Manage client expectations of the project content as it evolves.    •      Scope project work tasks, timelines and budgets in collaboration with representatives of the various IDEO disciplines.      KEY SELECTION CRITERIA    ·      Excellent verbal/written communication skills.    •      Fluency in English and Hindi    •      A true “customer service” attitude.    •      Exemplary time management and organizational skills.    •      Experience in navigating Indian business development with entrepreneurial/creative service consultancy or managing a key account.    •      University graduate in business, design, or related discipline.    •      A minimum of five years proven experience in highly innovative and international business environments.    •      Strong financial analysis, negotiation, and organizational skills.

Which UML models have you found to be more easily understood by Business Stakeholders?”  The UML Models and their preferred audiences cited by the respondents are:  -Activity Diagram [Dynamic]:Developers, Business Analysts  -Use Case Diagrams [Dynamic]: Business Analysts  -State Diagram [Dynamic]: Developers -Sequence Diagram [Dynamic]: Architects -Class Diagram [Static]: Developers -Component Diagram [Static]:Architects -Package Diagram [Static]: Architects,   At the heart of the two questions is a need for communication among various stakeholders involved in a System Development effort that potentially hosts significant Information System components.   Within the broader scope of Enterprise Architecture, two main domains are frequently outlined: the Business Architecture and the Technology Architecture (OMG SOA Consortium EA2010 Working Group, 2010). Ideally, the Business Architecture should host a coherent collection of business processes, practices, business motivations, operating models, capabilities, value chains, and organizational models – to list a few.  Ultimately, the Technology Architecture is a faithful instantiation of the Business Architecture. Technology Architecture gives substance to Business Architecture through various engineering artifacts that usually include significant Information Technology such as: Software Programs, Hardware Systems and Network Infrastructures.  These two broad Architectural domains (Business and Technology) respectively host two distinct groups of stakeholders: Business people and Technology people. These two groups of stakeholders traditionally speak and  respond to different languages that are determined by the nature of the artifacts they own and the activities they perform in their respective lines of duties.  Given the context previously outlined, the following issues and comments surfaced from the various responses I received:   -How can we bring business and technology stakeholders closer? -Conveying Information Effectively: what are the characteristics? -Just good enough modeling: who draws the line? -How easy is UML to learn by which stakeholder? -How often is UML style properly used? -BPMN vs UML -UML vs Agile/XP -UML vs Ubiquitous language  Feel free to comment on any item in the above list!

Every time I travel abroad, I find myself so graciously happy to be landing in San Diego.    Wow, setting up a VC fund!  Sounds like exciting work.    Recently, I've started to think that the next movement for a lot of the big technology companies is to farm out a lot of the R&D out to minor league type startups (instead of internally grow them) and then bring them in when they are successful.  Any truth in that?    Feel free to reach me on my cell phone at +1(703)786-7899 at any time.    At the risk of coming across as to eager, did you have any specific times in mind?
