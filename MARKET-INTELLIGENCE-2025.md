## THE REALITY CHECK: How Long This Actually Takes

### Executive Job Search Duration (Your Level)

**Industry Averages:**
- **VP-level Product roles**: 4-6 months average ([Source](https://www.endeavorexecutive.com/executive-job-search-length))
- **C-suite (CPO)**: 9-12 months average
- **General executive search**: 3-6 months typical ([Source](https://www.iqpartners.com/blog/how-long-will-it-take-to-find-a-job-in-2025/))
- **LinkedIn data**: Average executive job search = 10 months ([Source](https://campbellmorden.com/recruitment-articles/how-long-does-an-average-executive-job-search-take))

**Company Perspective (Time-to-Fill):**
- Executive roles: 3-6 months to fill
- Some roles stretch beyond 1 year
- Interview process alone: 4-6 weeks for product roles ([Source](https://nextsprints.com/guide/github-product-manager-interview-guide))

### Your 60-90 Day Target: AGGRESSIVE But Possible

**The Math:**
- Industry average: 4-6 months (120-180 days)
- Your goal: 60-90 days
- You need to be **2-3x faster than average**

**What This Means:**
- You can't do what everyone else does
- Network >>> job boards (10x faster with warm intros)
- Fractional >>> full-time (faster decision cycles)
- Multiple parallel processes >>> sequential applications
- Your Ross network is the key to compressing timeline

**Bottom Line**: 60 days is possible but requires flawless execution. 90 days is realistic with strong effort.

**Week 3-4**: Conversations
- 10-15 meaningful conversations
- 3-5 actual opportunities identified
- 2-3 fractional projects in discussion
- Interview processes starting

**Week 5-6**: Momentum

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR STRATEGY

### Do More Of:

2. **Fractional positioning** (faster, lower risk)
3. **Direct-to-founder outreach** (DTC brands)
4. **Free value first** (audits, office hours)
5. **LinkedIn content** (demonstrate expertise)

### Do Less Of:
1. Job board applications (generic VP Product roles)

3. Long email intros (keep it short)
4. Applying to roles outside e-commerce
5. Overthinking positioning

### Stop Doing:

2. Waiting to start outreach
3. Generic "product leader" positioning
4. Hiding SketchPop results
5. Focusing only on full-time roles

---

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE: Who You're Competing Against

### Other Candidates for These Roles:
- **Ex-FAANG PMs**: Strong resumes, but limited operator experience
- **Consulting to Product**: Strategic thinking, but theoretical
- **Career CPOs**: Deep experience, but expensive (full-time only)
- **Other founders**: Operator experience, but maybe not at your level
- **MBA to Product**: Credentials, but less practical experience

### Your Differentiation:
1. **Operator + MBA**: Rare combo (practical + strategic)
2. **Proven results**: $3M+ is real, not theoretical
3. **Domain expert**: E-commerce/Shopify native
4. **Flexible**: Can do fractional (most can't)
5. **Ross network**: Instant credibility with Ross community
6. **Immediate**: Can start tomorrow (no notice period)

### Where You Win:
- Companies wanting operator experience over resumes
- Series A-C needing strategic help without full-time cost
- DTC brands valuing "been there, done that"
- Ross alumni companies (trust/culture fit)
- Roles requiring e-commerce domain expertise

### Where You Might Lose:
- Companies wanting FAANG pedigree
- Roles needing specific industry (e.g., fintech, healthcare)
- Full-time roles where fractional isn't option
- Companies far from Ross network
- Roles requiring immediate team of 20+ (you're scaling)

**The key**: Target companies where you win, avoid where you don't.
