# Claude Code Project Rules for JobHunt

## 🚀 CRITICAL: Always Deploy to Vercel After HTML Updates

**RULE #1: Whenever you update ANY HTML file in this project, you MUST deploy to Vercel.**

This is not optional - it's a critical requirement because:
- The job search dashboard is live on Vercel
- Recruiters and hiring managers access the live site
- Local changes are useless if they're not deployed
- The user expects the live site to always be current

---

## 📋 Deployment Workflow (MANDATORY):

### After ANY HTML file edit:

1. **Test locally** (if needed)
   ```bash
   open <filename>.html
   ```

2. **Commit to git**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "Update: <description>"
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel** (REQUIRED)
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**
   - Check the deployment succeeded
   - Verify the live URL is updated

## 📁 HTML Files That Require Deployment:

- `resume.html` - Main resume (most important!)
- `job-search-dashboard.html` - Homepage
- `network-explorer.html` - LinkedIn network visualization
- `ai-tools.html` - AI tools page
- `analyze-linkedin-data.html` - LinkedIn data analysis
- `linkedin-import-converter.html` - Data import tool

**Any time you edit these files → DEPLOY TO VERCEL**

---

## ✅ Deployment Checklist:

When completing a task involving HTML files:
- [ ] Make the edits
- [ ] Commit changes (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (`vercel --prod`)
- [ ] Confirm deployment successful
- [ ] Mark task as complete

---

## 🎯 Why This Rule Exists:

The user maintains a live job search dashboard on Vercel that:
- Showcases their resume to recruiters
- Demonstrates their technical abilities
- Is actively shared with hiring managers
- Must always show the most current information

**Failing to deploy means the live site shows outdated information - unacceptable!**

## 📝 Additional Project Rules:

### Resume Content:
- Keep all LinkedIn copy under character limits (About: 2,600, Experience: 2,000)
- Maintain "Consumer product leader since 2013" positioning (accurate timeline)
- Emphasize data-driven decision making, conversion metrics, PLG experience
- Highlight major brands: TurboTax, Ancestry, eBay
- Use "30-person team" (not "artist network") for SketchPop

### File Management:
- Keep resume-backup.html as backup (don't update it)
- LINKEDIN-SECTIONS-BREAKDOWN.md is the main LinkedIn reference
- All markdown documentation should stay current with HTML changes

### Git Workflow:
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Always push to master after commits
- Use conventional commit style when appropriate

## 🔔 Reminder:

**HTML file updated? → Deploy to Vercel immediately**

This is the #1 rule for this project. Don't complete a task involving HTML files without deploying.
