# Claude Code Project Rules for JobHunt

## 🚀 CRITICAL: Always Deploy to Vercel After HTML Updates

**RULE #1: Whenever you update ANY HTML file in this project, you MUST deploy to Vercel.**

This is not optional - it's a critical requirement because:
- The job search dashboard is live on Vercel
- Recruiters and hiring managers access the live site
- Local changes are useless if they're not deployed
- The user expects the live site to always be current

---

## 📋 Deployment Workflow (MANDATORY):

### After ANY HTML file edit:

1. **Test locally** (if needed)
   ```bash
   open <filename>.html
   ```

2. **Commit to git**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "Update: <description>"
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel** (REQUIRED)
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**
   - Check the deployment succeeded
   - Verify the live URL is updated

---

## 📁 HTML Files That Require Deployment:

- `resume.html` - Main resume (most important!)
- `job-search-dashboard.html` - Homepage
- `network-explorer.html` - LinkedIn network visualization
- `ai-tools.html` - AI tools page
- `analyze-linkedin-data.html` - LinkedIn data analysis
- `linkedin-import-converter.html` - Data import tool

**Any time you edit these files → DEPLOY TO VERCEL**

---

## ✅ Deployment Checklist:

When completing a task involving HTML files:
- [ ] Make the edits
- [ ] Commit changes (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (`vercel --prod`)
- [ ] Confirm deployment successful
- [ ] Mark task as complete

---

## 🎯 Why This Rule Exists:

The user maintains a live job search dashboard on Vercel that:
- Showcases their resume to recruiters
- Demonstrates their technical abilities
- Is actively shared with hiring managers
- Must always show the most current information

**Failing to deploy means the live site shows outdated information - unacceptable!**

---

## 📝 Additional Project Rules:

### Resume Content:
- Keep all LinkedIn copy under character limits (About: 2,600, Experience: 2,000)
- Maintain "Consumer product leader since 2013" positioning (accurate timeline)
- Emphasize data-driven decision making, conversion metrics, PLG experience
- Highlight major brands: TurboTax, Ancestry, eBay
- Use "30-person team" (not "artist network") for SketchPop

### File Management:
- Keep resume-backup.html as backup (don't update it)
- LINKEDIN-SECTIONS-BREAKDOWN.md is the main LinkedIn reference
- All markdown documentation should stay current with HTML changes

### Git Workflow:
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Always push to master after commits
- Use conventional commit style when appropriate

---

## 🔔 Reminder:

**HTML file updated? → Deploy to Vercel immediately**

This is the #1 rule for this project. Don't complete a task involving HTML files without deploying.

## 📋 Action Items Management (Obsidian Vault)

**RULE: When the user mentions tasks, action items, or "things to do", automatically update the Obsidian vault.**

### Action Items Location:
- **File**: `/Users/lcalderon/github/JobHunt/Jobhunt/20-Actions/Action Items.md`
- **Dashboard**: `/Users/lcalderon/github/JobHunt/Jobhunt/20-Actions/Action Dashboard.md`
- **Workflow Guide**: `/Users/lcalderon/github/JobHunt/Jobhunt/20-Actions/ACTION-ITEMS-WORKFLOW.md`

### When to Update Action Items:
- User mentions tasks or action items
- User says "add this to my todo list" or similar
- User asks "what are my action items?" (read and summarize)
- After planning sessions, add next steps as action items

### Action Item Format:
```markdown
- [ ] Task description #tag1 #tag2 #next-action
```

### Available Tags:
- `#next-action` - High priority, do next
- `#jobhunt` - Job search related
- `#networking` - Networking/outreach
- `#admin` - Administrative tasks
- `#research` - Research tasks
- `#follow-up` - Follow-up items
- `#urgent` - Urgent items

### Sections to Use:
- `## Inbox` - New items, unsorted
- `## Job Search` - Job applications, interviews, etc.
- `## Networking` - Outreach, connections, messages
- `## Admin` - Administrative tasks
- `## Research` - Company research, role research
- `## Follow-ups` - Items requiring follow-up

### Update Process:
1. Read current `Action Items.md`
2. Add new items to appropriate section
3. Update the `updated` timestamp in frontmatter (format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS PST`)
4. Use appropriate tags
5. Save the file

**This ensures action items persist across all Cursor sessions and sync with Obsidian automatically.**
