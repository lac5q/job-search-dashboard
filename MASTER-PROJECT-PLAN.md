## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Holiday Slowdown (Dec 23-Jan 2)
**Probability**: HIGH
**Impact**: MEDIUM (delays by 1-2 weeks)
**Mitigation**:
- Front-load applications in Week 1-3
- Use holiday week for interview prep
- Target companies that don't shut down (startups)

### Risk 2: Consulting Takes Over Search
**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: HIGH (extends timeline to 120+ days)
**Mitigation**:
- Cap consulting at 2 clients max
- Set firm Q1 2026 end date for consulting
- Block time daily for full-time search (non-negotiable)

### Risk 3: SketchPop Crisis During Search
**Probability**: LOW
**Impact**: HIGH (derails search completely)
**Mitigation**:
- Start delegating to wife NOW (Week 1)
- Document critical processes early
- Set boundaries (wife handles 90% by Week 4)

### Risk 4: Ross Network Doesn't Respond
**Probability**: LOW
**Impact**: MEDIUM (slows down process)
**Mitigation**:
- Cast wide net (100+ alumni contacted)
- Follow up persistently (3 touchpoints per person)
- Use multiple channels (LinkedIn, email, phone)

### Risk 5: Offers Below $200K
**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM (forces negotiation or rejection)
**Mitigation**:
- Target right-sized companies (Series B-C, mid-market)
- Lead with Intuit $1B scope in all conversations
- Be willing to walk away (consulting covers bills)
