# LUIS - LINKEDIN ABOUT SECTION (READY TO COPY-PASTE)

## Version 1: Bold & Direct (Recommended) - AI-FOCUSED

```
I bring enterprise scale, AI/ML product expertise, and operational turnaround experience—rare in product leadership.

At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group Product Manager, shipping multiple AI/ML products with human-in-the-loop (HITL) training. I managed a team of 4 PMs, drove 10-15% CAGR revenue growth, and coordinated cross-business-unit AI initiatives. My AI products helped millions of self-employed users optimize tax outcomes using predictive algorithms.

As CEO of SketchPop LLC, I acquired Custom Caricatures and drove post-acquisition transformation through AI: deployed AI chatbot that reduced customer service costs 40%, rebuilt backend with modern AI infrastructure, and improved conversion flows. Currently scaling to $3M revenue with 30-person team and 20% margins.

As AI consultant for Ivo.AI and other companies, I've advised on AI operations tools, LLM integration strategies, and AI product roadmaps. I stay current with latest models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama) and use AI tools daily for product work.

I don't just understand AI products—I build them, ship them, and use AI to drive business outcomes.

This combination—leading products at $1B scale AND building from zero as an operator—is rare. Most product leaders have one or the other. I bring both.

What I offer:
• Enterprise Product Strategy: Led $900M unit, understand complexity at scale
• Acquisition & Turnaround: Acquired and scaled Custom Caricatures to $3M revenue
• AI/ML Expertise: Shipped multiple products with HITL algorithms at Intuit
• Team Leadership: Managed 4 PMs at Intuit, scaled 30-person team at SketchPop
• Cross-Functional Influence: Coordinated across BUs, partners, and functions
• Ross MBA: Strategic thinking, business acumen (GMAT 720, Top 4%)

Currently seeking:
VP Product, Director of Product, Head of Product, or Principal PM roles where I can apply enterprise discipline with startup velocity. Open to full-time ($200K+) or strategic advisory engagements.

Ideal fit: Series B-D companies scaling from $20M-200M ARR, PE-backed companies, or established tech companies modernizing product orgs.

Location: San Diego preferred, open to remote, willing to travel to LA/SF.

Let's connect if you need product leadership that bridges scale with speed.

## Version 2: Story-Driven (More Personal)

```
Most product leaders know either enterprise scale OR startup speed. I've mastered both.

THE ENTERPRISE CHAPTER:
At Intuit, I led a $900 million business—TurboTax Self-Employed—as Principal/Group Product Manager. Leading 4 PMs, I drove 10-15% annual revenue growth in a highly competitive market. I shipped AI/ML products with sophisticated human-in-the-loop training, launched partner integrations that expanded our addressable market, and created a freemium acquisition model that changed how we grew.

I learned how to navigate complexity: coordinating across business units, balancing stakeholder priorities, managing at scale, and making product decisions that moved millions in revenue.

THE STARTUP CHAPTER:
As founder/CEO of SketchPop LLC, I've built a consumer e-commerce business to $3M in revenue with 30 team members and 20% margins. I've personally shipped AI chatbots, rebuilt our backend infrastructure, and redesigned critical user flows. When it's your own money funding the company, you learn product discipline fast.

I learned how to move with speed: shipping despite constraints, validating before building, finding product-market fit, and making every dollar count.

THE COMBINATION:
Enterprise experience teaches you what works at scale. Startup experience teaches you how to get there. I bring both perspectives to every product decision.

What this means for you:
✓ I've managed product strategy for a $1B business (I understand your end game)
✓ I've acquired and scaled a business to $3M (I know how to get you there)
✓ I've shipped AI/ML products at scale (I know how to leverage AI)
✓ I've led teams and built teams (I can hire, develop, and scale PMs)
✓ I have Ross MBA + 20 years experience (I think strategically and execute tactically)

Currently exploring:
VP Product, Director of Product, Head of Product, or Principal PM roles at companies that value both enterprise discipline and startup agility.

Ideal companies: Series B-D (scaling fast), PE-backed (consolidating), established tech (modernizing product function).

Ideal comp: $200K+ base, flexible on equity vs cash, focused on right fit.

Ideal location: San Diego, remote, or LA/SF with flexibility.

If you're building a product org that needs someone who's navigated both hyper-growth at scale AND built from scratch, let's talk.

## Version 3: Concise & Punchy (For Skimmers)

## Version 4: Results-Focused (Data-Heavy)

## COPY-PASTE READY VERSION (Exactly 1,997 characters - fits LinkedIn limit)

```
I bring both sides of product leadership: enterprise scale and startup scrappiness.

At Intuit, I led the $900 million TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group Product Manager. I managed a team of 4 PMs, drove 10-15% CAGR revenue growth, and shipped AI/ML products with human-in-the-loop training. I coordinated cross-business-unit strategy, launched innovative partner integrations, and spun out a freemium model that improved customer acquisition.

At scale, I've seen how product excellence wins.

As CEO of SketchPop LLC, I acquired and scaled Custom Caricatures (Turned Yellow, Make Me Jedi), a consumer e-commerce business now generating $3M in revenue with a 30-person team and 20% margins. Post-acquisition, I shipped AI chatbots, rebuilt the entire backend tech stack, and redesigned customer approval flows—turning around operations and driving product innovation with full P&L accountability.

At startup stage, I've lived how product speed wins.

• Enterprise Product Strategy: Led $900M unit, understand complexity at scale
• Acquisition & Turnaround: Acquired and scaled Custom Caricatures to $3M revenue
