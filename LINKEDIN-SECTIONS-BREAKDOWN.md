I'm a data-driven product leader who turns user insights into growth. Equally comfortable managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire. Consumer product leader since 2013 across TurboTax, Ancestry, eBay—deep AI/ML expertise, proven conversion optimization.

At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group PM serving 4M+ solopreneurs. Managed 4 PMs while staying hands-on—drove 10-15% CAGR ($100-150M annual growth) through data-driven decisions, A/B testing, and shipped 4 AI/ML products that reduced friction and improved conversion.

My superpower: using data analysis to make the right product calls. At TurboTax, analyzed user behavior to identify drop-offs, then shipped AI features that increased completion rates. At Ancestry, led growth initiatives achieving 30% mobile lift and 5% revenue boost from abandon cart. At eBay, drove $100M+ business lift through 2% checkout optimization. Pure PLG motion—no sales team, self-serve at scale.

As CEO of SketchPop ($3M consumer e-commerce, 20% margins), I wear many hats: solo product leader working with engineers, plus marketing, operations, finance. Use AI as decision-making partner—design experiences, automate tasks, optimize funnels. I write specs, analyze data, work with engineers daily, ship fast.

I thrive in both leadership and IC roles. Led product teams at Intuit (4 PMs) and eBay (6+ analysts), now solo product leader at SketchPop—what matters is shipping great products and building great culture.

What I bring:
• Data-Driven Decision Making: Track record—+2% at eBay ($100M+), 30% at Ancestry, 5% revenue lift
• Product-Led Growth: Led PLG at scale (TurboTax $900M, Ancestry $800M, eBay)—freemium, self-serve
• AI/ML for Growth: Shipped 4 AI products at Intuit (pre-ChatGPT); use AI as force multiplier at SketchPop
• Consumer at Scale: Led products serving millions—TurboTax (4M+ users), Ancestry, eBay since 2013
• Hands-On Execution: Work with engineering, write specs, ship products personally
• Team & Culture: Hire and scale PM teams (Intuit, eBay) while building great culture

Currently seeking: VP Product, Director Product, or Principal PM roles at PLG/consumer/SMB companies where data-driven decision making drives growth. Open to managing a team OR being solo IC hire—I thrive in both.

Ideal fit: PLG companies (Notion, Canva, Figma), consumer products (Duolingo, Grammarly), SMB tools (Shopify, Faire). I work best where product leaders are hands-on, data-obsessed, culture matters.

Location: San Diego preferred, open to remote, willing to travel to LA/SF.
