## 🔄 OLD vs NEW Positioning

### ❌ OLD (INCORRECT):
> "As **founder/CEO** of SketchPop LLC, I've **built** a consumer e-commerce business generating $3M..."

**Problem:** Implies you started from $0, built from scratch

### ✅ NEW (CORRECT):
> "As **CEO** of SketchPop LLC, I **acquired and scaled** Custom Caricatures (Turned Yellow, Make Me Jedi), a consumer e-commerce business now generating $3M in revenue with a 30-person team and 20% margins. Post-acquisition, I shipped AI chatbots, rebuilt the entire backend tech stack, and redesigned customer approval flows—turning around operations and driving product innovation with full P&L accountability."

**Why this is BETTER:**
- ✅ Shows **acquisition experience** (valuable skill for PE-backed companies)
- ✅ Shows **operational turnaround** (you improved an existing business)
- ✅ Shows **post-acquisition value creation** (product innovation, tech modernization)
- ✅ Shows **full P&L accountability** (ran the business after acquiring it)
- ✅ More accurate and ethical (no misleading about founding)
