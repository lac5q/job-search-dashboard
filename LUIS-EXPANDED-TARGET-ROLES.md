## The "Overqualified" Concern

### When Applying to Senior PM or Director Roles:

**Companies might think**: "He managed $1B at Intuit, why would he want Director role?"

**Your response** (proactively address in cover letter/interviews):

> "I'm optimizing for the right company, team, and problem - not title. I led a large business at Intuit and built my own company, so I've done both scale and startup. What I'm looking for now is a company where I can have significant product impact and work with a great team. Whether that's as Director, VP, or Principal PM is less important than the opportunity itself.
>
> I've found that title matters less than:
> 1. The product challenge (is it meaningful?)
> 2. The team (will I learn and grow?)
> 3. The company trajectory (is it going somewhere?)
> 4. The comp package (does it reflect value I bring?)
>
> If those align, I'm flexible on the title."

**This positions you as:**
- Mature (not title-chasing)
- Practical (focused on substance)
- Low-ego (team player)
- Confident (secure in experience)

---

## Interview Prep (For Different Levels)

### For VP Product Interviews:
**Emphasize:**
- $1B P&L management at Intuit
- Team leadership (hired/developed 4 PMs)
- Strategic thinking (cross-BU coordination)
- Growth track record (10-15% CAGR)

**Example answer**: "At Intuit, I managed the $1B Self-Employed business, which meant..."

---

### For Director/Head of Product Interviews:
**Emphasize:**
- Team building (hiring, mentoring PMs)
- Execution excellence (shipped AI/ML products)
- Cross-functional leadership (worked across BUs)
- Hands-on + strategic (built SketchPop)

**Example answer**: "I led a team of 4 PMs at Intuit and built a 30-person company at SketchPop, so I understand both delegation and getting hands-on when needed..."

---

### For Principal/Senior PM Interviews:
**Emphasize:**
- Technical depth (AI/ML with HITL)
- Strategic impact ($1B business decisions)
- IC strength (can operate autonomously)
- Scope of influence (cross-BU work)

**Example answer**: "While I managed PMs at Intuit, I was very hands-on with product decisions - I shipped the AI/ML features myself, working directly with data science..."

---

## Comp Negotiation (By Role)

### For VP Product Offer:
"Based on managing a $1B P&L at Intuit with proven 10-15% CAGR growth, I'm targeting $220-280K base. How does this role's scope and your budget align with that?"

### For Director Offer:
"Given my background leading teams and managing significant P&L at Intuit, plus building my own company, I'm looking for $200-240K base for a Director role. Is that in range?"

### For Principal PM Offer:
"For a Principal PM role at [Company], I'm targeting $200K+ total comp. My Intuit experience managing $1B P&L and shipping AI/ML products should map to senior IC compensation."

**Key**: Always anchor high, show flexibility on equity vs cash, emphasize total package.
