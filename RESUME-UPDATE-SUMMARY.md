2. **`NEW-EXPERIENCES-FOR-RESUME.md`** - Complete documentation of all new content

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS:

### What's Done:
- ✅ All new experience content written (HTML and LinkedIn copy format)
- ✅ All LinkedIn copy text verified under 2,000 characters
- ✅ Toggle checkbox CSS designed
- ✅ JavaScript toggle functions written
- ✅ All experiences aligned with PLG/consumer/SMB story

### What Needs To Be Done:
The complete updated resume HTML file is designed but needs to be assembled due to file size limitations with the Write tool.

### Options to Complete:

#### **OPTION A: Manual Assembly (Recommended - Fastest)**
1. Open `/Users/lcalderon/JobHunt/resume-backup.html` in a text editor
2. Save as `resume.html`
3. Add CSS for toggles (see NEW-EXPERIENCES-FOR-RESUME.md)
4. Add toggle control panel HTML
5. Add 5 new experience sections
6. Update JavaScript with new copyLinkedInFormat() cases

#### **OPTION B: I Can Create Smaller Targeted Edits**
I can use the Edit tool to make specific, surgical changes to the resume-backup.html file in multiple steps:
1. First pass: Add CSS
2. Second pass: Add HTML for toggles
3. Third pass: Add new experiences
4. Fourth pass: Update JavaScript

#### **OPTION C: Use The Python Script**
Run the Python script I created to do the updates programmatically (would need to be completed).
