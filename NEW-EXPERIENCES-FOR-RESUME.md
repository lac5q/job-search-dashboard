## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:

Due to file size, I created the complete updated resume as a new file. The issue was that the Write tool had trouble with such a large file (75KB+).

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. I need to use a different approach to update the existing resume.html
2. I'll use the Edit tool to make surgical changes to specific sections
3. Or you can manually review and confirm the changes look correct

Would you like me to:
A) Try to update the resume.html using targeted Edit commands
B) Provide you with the specific sections to manually paste
C) Create a simpler version with just the key changes highlighted
