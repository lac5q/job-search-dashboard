```html
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I'm a data-driven product leader who turns user insights into growth. Equally comfortable managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire. <strong>Consumer product leader since 2013</strong> across TurboTax, Ancestry, eBay—deep AI/ML expertise, proven conversion optimization.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group PM serving 4M+ solopreneurs, freelancers, gig workers. Managed 4 PMs while staying hands-on—drove 10-15% CAGR ($100-150M annual growth) through data-driven decisions, A/B testing, and shipped 4 AI/ML products that reduced friction and improved conversion.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>My superpower: using data analysis to make the right product calls.</strong> At TurboTax, analyzed user behavior across millions of sessions to identify drop-offs, then shipped AI features that increased completion rates. At Ancestry, led growth initiatives achieving 30% mobile conversion lift and 5% revenue boost from abandon cart. At eBay, drove $100M+ business lift through 2% checkout optimization. Pure PLG motion—no sales team, self-serve at scale.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">As CEO of SketchPop ($3M consumer e-commerce, 20% margins), I wear many hats: solo product leader working with engineers, plus marketing, operations, finance. Acquired through Epilogue Capital (my investment firm focused on consumer/SMB businesses). Use AI as decision-making partner—design experiences, automate tasks, optimize funnels. I write specs, analyze data, work with engineers daily, ship fast.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I thrive in both leadership and IC roles. Led product teams at Intuit (4 PMs) and eBay (6+ analysts), now solo product leader at SketchPop—what matters is shipping great products and building great culture.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>What I bring:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">

                        <li><strong>Consumer at Scale:</strong> Led products serving millions across TurboTax (4M+ users), Ancestry, eBay marketplace since 2013</li>
                        <li><strong>Hands-On Execution:</strong> Work with engineering, write specs, define requirements, ship products personally</li>
                        <li><strong>Team & Culture:</strong> Hire and scale PM teams (Intuit, eBay) while building great culture</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Currently seeking:</strong> VP Product, Director Product, or Principal PM roles at PLG/consumer/SMB companies where data-driven decision making drives growth. Open to managing a team OR being solo IC hire—I thrive in both.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Ideal fit:</strong> PLG companies (Notion, Canva, Figma), consumer products (Duolingo, Grammarly), SMB tools (Shopify, Faire) building AI products. I work best where product leaders are hands-on, data-obsessed, culture matters.</p>

## PART 4: JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS (Add inside the `<script>` tag)

Find the `copyLinkedInFormat()` function and **REPLACE** the existing 'executive-summary' and 'linkedin-about' cases, then add the new experience cases BEFORE the final `}` of that function:

### UPDATE Executive Summary and LinkedIn About cases:

```javascript
            if (jobType === 'executive-summary') {
                text = `Data-Driven Product Leader—PLG/Consumer/SMB Expert. Turn user insights into growth through analytics, experimentation, and AI. Equally comfortable managing teams OR being hands-on IC.

Consumer product leader since 2013 across iconic brands: TurboTax ($900M, 4M+ users), Ancestry ($800M subscriptions), eBay (global marketplace). Now run SketchPop ($3M consumer e-commerce) as CEO. Core superpower: data-driven decision making—analyze user behavior, run experiments, use insights to ship features that drive conversion and retention. Distinguished by shipping AI/ML products BEFORE ChatGPT hype, then rapidly adopting modern LLMs. Rare combination of:

• Data-Driven Decision Making: Analyze user behavior across millions of sessions, run A/B tests, use cohort analysis and funnel optimization to prioritize ruthlessly—my core superpower. Track record: +2% checkout conversion at eBay ($100M+ lift), 30% mobile conversion lift at Ancestry, 5% revenue lift from abandon cart
• Product-Led Growth: Led $900M PLG business at Intuit with zero sales team—freemium models, self-serve onboarding, conversion optimization. Also led growth initiatives at Ancestry ($800M subscriptions) and eBay marketplace
• Consumer/SMB at Scale: Served 4M+ solopreneurs at TurboTax, millions of consumers at Ancestry and eBay—understand consumer behavior, retention, engagement metrics deeply across multiple product types
• AI/ML for Growth: Shipped 4 AI products to reduce friction and drive conversion at Intuit (pre-ChatGPT), deployed modern LLMs at SketchPop (40% cost reduction)
• Multi-Scale Experience: $900M enterprise (Intuit) → $800M consumer subscriptions (Ancestry) → Global marketplace (eBay) → $3M SMB (SketchPop)

Seeking: VP Product, Director Product, or Principal PM roles at PLG/consumer/SMB companies (Notion, Canva, Figma, Duolingo, Shopify) where data-driven decision making drives growth. Equally comfortable managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire—I thrive in both.`;
            } else if (jobType === 'linkedin-about') {
                text = `I'm a data-driven product leader who turns user insights into growth. Equally comfortable managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire. Consumer product leader since 2013 across TurboTax, Ancestry, eBay—deep AI/ML expertise, proven conversion optimization.

At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group PM serving 4M+ solopreneurs, freelancers, gig workers. Managed 4 PMs while staying hands-on—drove 10-15% CAGR ($100-150M annual growth) through data-driven decisions, A/B testing, and shipped 4 AI/ML products that reduced friction and improved conversion.

My superpower: using data analysis to make the right product calls. At TurboTax, analyzed user behavior across millions of sessions to identify drop-offs, then shipped AI features that increased completion rates. At Ancestry, led growth initiatives achieving 30% mobile conversion lift and 5% revenue boost from abandon cart. At eBay, drove $100M+ business lift through 2% checkout optimization. Pure PLG motion—no sales team, self-serve at scale.

As CEO of SketchPop ($3M consumer e-commerce, 20% margins), I wear many hats: solo product leader working with engineers, plus marketing, operations, finance. Acquired through Epilogue Capital (my investment firm focused on consumer/SMB businesses). Use AI as decision-making partner—design experiences, automate tasks, optimize funnels. I write specs, analyze data, work with engineers daily, ship fast.

I thrive in both leadership and IC roles. Led product teams at Intuit (4 PMs) and eBay (6+ analysts), now solo product leader at SketchPop—what matters is shipping great products and building great culture.

What I bring:
• Data-Driven Decision Making: Track record of conversion wins—+2% at eBay ($100M+), 30% at Ancestry, 5% revenue lift—my core superpower
• Product-Led Growth: Led PLG at scale (TurboTax $900M, Ancestry $800M, eBay marketplace)—freemium, self-serve, optimization
• AI/ML for Growth: Shipped 4 AI products at Intuit (pre-ChatGPT); use AI as force multiplier at SketchPop
• Consumer at Scale: Led products serving millions across TurboTax (4M+ users), Ancestry, eBay marketplace since 2013
• Hands-On Execution: Work with engineering, write specs, define requirements, ship products personally
• Team & Culture: Hire and scale PM teams (Intuit, eBay) while building great culture

Currently seeking: VP Product, Director Product, or Principal PM roles at PLG/consumer/SMB companies where data-driven decision making drives growth. Open to managing a team OR being solo IC hire—I thrive in both.

Ideal fit: PLG companies (Notion, Canva, Figma), consumer products (Duolingo, Grammarly), SMB tools (Shopify, Faire) building AI products. I work best where product leaders are hands-on, data-obsessed, culture matters.

Location: San Diego preferred, open to remote, willing to travel to LA/SF.`;

Then add these NEW FUNCTIONS at the end of the `<script>` section, before the closing `</script>` tag:

```javascript
        function toggleExperience(experienceId, isChecked) {
            const element = document.getElementById(experienceId);
            if (element) {
                if (isChecked) {
                    element.classList.remove('hidden');
                } else {
                    element.classList.add('hidden');
                }
            }
        }

        function toggleCheckbox(checkboxId) {
            const checkbox = document.getElementById(checkboxId);
            checkbox.checked = !checkbox.checked;
            checkbox.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'));
        }

        function toggleAllExperiences(checked) {
            const checkboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.experience-toggle input[type="checkbox"]');
            checkboxes.forEach(cb => {
                cb.checked = checked;
                cb.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'));
            });
        }

        function toggleRecommended() {
            // Recommended experiences (⭐)
            const recommended = ['toggle-intuit', 'toggle-sketchpop', 'toggle-growthalchemylab',
                               'toggle-epilogue', 'toggle-ancestry', 'toggle-ebay'];

            const allCheckboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.experience-toggle input[type="checkbox"]');
            allCheckboxes.forEach(cb => {
                cb.checked = recommended.includes(cb.id);
                cb.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'));
            });
        }
```

Also update the `copySectionToClipboard()` function - add these lines at the beginning, right after the `const clone = section.cloneNode(true);` line:

```javascript
            // Remove hidden experience items
            const hiddenItems = clone.querySelectorAll('.experience-item.hidden');
            hiddenItems.forEach(item => item.remove());

            // Remove toggle section if copying experience section
            const toggleSection = clone.querySelector('.toggle-section');
            if (toggleSection) toggleSection.remove();
```
