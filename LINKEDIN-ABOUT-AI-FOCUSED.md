## 🤖 COPY-PASTE READY - AI EXPERTISE HIGHLIGHTED

```
I bring enterprise scale, AI/ML product expertise, and operational turnaround experience—rare in product leadership.

At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group Product Manager, shipping multiple AI/ML products with human-in-the-loop (HITL) training. I managed a team of 4 PMs, drove 10-15% CAGR revenue growth, and coordinated cross-business-unit AI initiatives. My AI products helped millions of self-employed users optimize tax outcomes using predictive algorithms.

As CEO of SketchPop LLC, I acquired Custom Caricatures and drove post-acquisition transformation through AI: deployed AI agents for customer service (40% cost reduction), rebuilt backend with modern AI infrastructure, and implemented AI-driven approval flows. I work extensively with AI agents, LLM orchestration, and operational AI deployment. Currently scaling to $3M revenue with 30-person team and 20% margins.

I stay current with latest AI developments—daily user of GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama for product work and have consulted on AI operations (including sales AI at Ivo.AI).

I don't just understand AI products—I ship them at scale and deploy them operationally to drive measurable business outcomes.

What I offer:
• AI/ML Product Leadership: Shipped HITL products at $900M scale (Intuit), deployed AI agents operationally (SketchPop 40% cost reduction), work extensively with AI agents and LLM orchestration
• Enterprise Product Strategy: Led $900M unit with cross-BU AI coordination
• Acquisition & Turnaround: Acquired business, drove AI-powered transformation to scale
• Operational AI Deployment: Real-world experience implementing AI agents, customer service automation, AI-driven workflows
• Current AI Knowledge: Daily user of GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama; hands-on with AI agent frameworks and LLM orchestration
• Team Leadership: Managed 4 PMs at Intuit, scaled 30-person team at SketchPop
• Ross MBA: Strategic thinking, business acumen (GMAT 720, Top 4%)

Currently seeking:
VP Product, Director of Product, Head of Product, or Principal PM roles where I can lead AI/ML product initiatives at scale. Particularly interested in companies embedding AI into their core products or building AI-first experiences.

Ideal fit: Series B-D companies scaling AI products, PE-backed companies modernizing with AI, or established tech companies building AI product orgs.

Location: San Diego preferred, open to remote, willing to travel to LA/SF.

Let's connect if you need product leadership that combines enterprise AI experience with hands-on AI implementation.

## 📊 AI-Specific Interview Prep

### Question: "What AI products have you shipped?"

**Your Answer:**
> "I've shipped AI products at two extremes:
>
> At Intuit, I shipped multiple AI/ML products with human-in-the-loop training for the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business. These products used predictive algorithms to help millions of users optimize their tax outcomes. We coordinated across business units to ensure consistent AI experiences.
>
> At SketchPop, I deployed an AI chatbot that reduced customer service costs by 40% while maintaining customer satisfaction. I also rebuilt our backend with modern AI infrastructure to enable future AI features.
>
> As a consultant for Ivo.AI, I've advised on AI operations tools and LLM integration strategies.
>
> I stay current by using GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama daily in my product work."

---

### Question: "How do you measure AI product success?"

**Your Answer:**
> "I measure AI success at three levels:
>
> 1. **Business Metrics:** At SketchPop, our AI chatbot reduced costs 40% while maintaining CSAT. At Intuit, our HITL algorithms improved tax optimization outcomes for millions of users.
>
> 2. **Product Metrics:** Adoption rate, time-to-value, accuracy/precision of AI features, user satisfaction with AI outputs.
>
> 3. **Technical Metrics:** Model performance, latency, hallucination rates for LLMs, human-in-the-loop effectiveness.
>
> The key is connecting AI metrics to business outcomes—cost reduction, revenue growth, user retention, or operational efficiency."

---

### Question: "What's your approach to building vs buying AI?"

**Your Answer:**
> "It depends on three factors:
>
> 1. **Core Differentiation:** If AI is your core differentiator, build. If it's table stakes, buy or use APIs.
>
> 2. **Data Advantage:** If you have unique data, build custom models. If not, leverage foundation models via API.
>
> 3. **Speed to Market:** At SketchPop, I used third-party chatbot APIs to get 40% cost reduction fast. At Intuit, we built custom HITL models because tax optimization was our core value.
>
> My default: Start with APIs (GPT-4, Claude) to prove value, then build custom if data/differentiation warrant it."
