# Targeting Expansion (Priority Focus) — v2025-12-11

**Created**: 2025-12-11 14:30:37 PST  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-11 14:30:37 PST  

**Scope**: Expand your existing priority target list with three additional target segments:
1) Venture-backed B2B companies
2) AI implementation teams (Anthropic + adjacent)
3) PE holding companies / portfolio-ops teams focused on unlocking EBITDA with AI

## 0) Your existing “priority list” (what we’re anchoring to)
Your current strategy already has the right skeleton:
- **Role focus**: Tier 1 sweet spot = **Director/Head of Product** at **Series B–C** or mid-market; plus adjacent **VP Product (smaller cos)** and **Principal PM (large tech)**.
- **Target companies**: SD + remote-first + LA/SF lists, plus a large network-derived database in `target-companies.js` with tiers.

**What this document adds** is a *targeting overlay* that makes your daily search more systematic and higher-signal.

---

## 1) Segment A — Venture-backed B2B companies (your highest-leverage expansion)
### Why this segment fits you
- You’ve got **scale + operator** credibility (Intuit $1B + founder), which maps cleanly to **Series B–D** B2B companies building repeatable GTM + product org.
- These companies hire faster than mega-cap, but pay closer to your target comp than early seed.

### What to target (filters)
- **Stage**: Series B–D (or “growth-stage”, “late-stage startup”, “unicorn”)
- **Motion**: PLG + sales-assist (best for your AI + growth + monetization story)
- **Team**: 3–20 PM org; building leadership layer

### Job-title targeting (use these synonyms)
- Director of Product / Head of Product / Group PM
- VP Product (Series B–C)
- Principal Product Manager (platform / growth / monetization)

### “Venture-backed B2B” starter target list (examples)
Prioritize companies where you can credibly pitch **AI-enabled growth + monetization + operations**.

- **Fintech / B2B payments & spend**: Ramp, Brex, Mercury, Plaid
- **Workforce / HR / ops**: Deel, Rippling, Gusto
- **Data / analytics / infra**: Databricks, Snowflake, dbt Labs, Hightouch
- **DevTools / platform**: Retool, Sentry, PostHog, Vercel
- **PLG B2B apps**: Notion, Airtable, Figma, Canva, Atlassian (public but PLG benchmark)
- **Security (strong PM culture)**: Wiz, Snyk

### Practical search queries (copy/paste)
- **LinkedIn Jobs**:
  - `("director of product" OR "head of product" OR "group product manager") AND (series b OR series c OR "venture backed" OR "growth stage")`
  - Add vertical keywords: `(fintech OR payments OR commerce OR "developer tools" OR analytics OR "data platform")`

---

## 2) Segment B — AI implementation teams (Anthropic + adjacent)
### What “AI implementation teams” means in practice
These are the teams that make LLMs work for enterprise customers:
- **Applied AI / Solutions Architecture**
- **Product Engineering (customer-facing)**
- **Engagement / Program / Delivery (technical)**
- **Forward Deployed Engineering**

Anthropic explicitly uses an “Applied AI” framing for these roles (Solutions Architecture, Product Engineering, Engagement Mgmt).

### Target orgs (companies)
- **Frontier model companies**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere, Mistral AI
- **AI delivery platforms**: Scale AI
- **Enterprise AI platforms**: Databricks, Snowflake
- **Cloud AI distribution**: Microsoft (Azure AI), Google (Vertex AI), AWS (Bedrock)
- **Enterprise software pushing “AI in production”**: ServiceNow, Salesforce

### Titles to target (the exact surface area)
- Solutions Architect (Applied AI)
- Forward Deployed Engineer / Customer Engineer
- Product Engineer (GTM / Applied)
- Engagement Manager (Applied AI)
- Technical Program Manager (AI delivery)
- Product Manager (AI Platform / AI Enablement / AI GTM)

### Positioning angle (what you’re selling)
- You’re not “AI hype.” You’re **AI implementation + product value creation**:
  - “Ship AI into workflows” (HITL, quality, safety)
  - “Tie AI to business metrics” (conversion, funnel, retention, productivity)
  - “Enterprise constraints” (security, privacy, rollout, change management)

---

## 3) Segment C — Private equity holding companies focused on AI-driven EBITDA unlock
### What to target (and why)
PE firms increasingly run **portfolio operations / value creation** functions and are now formalizing AI enablement across portfolios.

**Best target entry points**:
- Portfolio Operations / Value Creation teams
- Operating Partners (software + product + GTM)
- “Digital transformation / AI enablement” leaders

### Proof this is real (examples)
- **Vista** is explicitly public about scaling AI across portfolio companies via its AI value creation capability (see Vista’s “Agentic AI Factory / Vista Intelligence”).
- **Thoma Bravo** publicly emphasizes operating-partner involvement and AI-driven software outcomes in software acquisitions.

### PE firm target list (prioritize software-heavy platforms)
- Vista Equity Partners
- Thoma Bravo
- Silver Lake
- Blackstone
- Bain Capital
- Apollo Global Management
- KKR
- TPG
- Carlyle
- Francisco Partners
- Hg
- Permira
- Hellman & Friedman
- Warburg Pincus
- Advent
- TA Associates

### Titles to target (PE + portfolio)
- Operating Partner (Product / GTM / Technology)
- Head of Portfolio Operations / Portfolio Ops
- Value Creation Principal / Director
- Digital Transformation / AI Enablement Lead
- CTO Office / Transformation Office

### Your outreach offer (high-response framing)
- “I help portfolio companies convert AI into EBITDA, not demos”
- Offer a **30–45 min ‘AI EBITDA audit’** (free) with 3 outputs:
  1) 90-day AI opportunity map (top 5 use-cases)
  2) ROI model + instrumentation plan
  3) Delivery plan (pilot → scale)

### Bonus: you already have PE signals in your network database
From `target-companies.js`, you already have some PE/holding-company nodes in-network (e.g., Silver Lake, Blackstone, Bain Capital, Apollo Global Management). That’s enough to start targeted outreach immediately.

## 4) How to execute this (daily/weekly operating system)
### Saved searches (set these up today)
- **Search 1 (Venture-backed B2B)**: Director/Head/Group PM + Series B–D + your vertical keywords
- **Search 2 (AI implementation)**: Applied AI / Solutions Architect / Engagement Manager / Forward Deployed + Anthropic/OpenAI/Scale/Databricks/Snowflake
- **Search 3 (PE value creation)**: Operating Partner / Portfolio Ops / Value Creation + (Vista/Thoma/etc.)

### Weekly output targets (simple and aggressive)
- **10** venture-backed B2B apps (mostly Director/Head)
- **5** AI implementation roles (Applied AI / Product Engineering / PM AI enablement)
- **15** PE / portfolio-ops outreach messages (warm where possible)

## 5) Next step I can do for you (fast)
If you want, I can generate a **tight top-25 list** for each segment **filtered down to what’s already in your `target-companies.js` network** (so every target has at least some adjacency for warm intros).
